# RIDE - Questionnaire Data Summary

This branch is part of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/i-d-e/ride) for the reviewing journal RIDE (http://ride.i-d-e.de). It contains summaries of the data gathered in the RIDE questionnaires.

## Contents
Each review in RIDE is accompanied by a so-called *factsheet* containing questions and answers about the reviewed resource. This data is gathered in two types of questionnaires, one for scholarly editions and the other for text collections (including corpora). 

So far, there are 40 reviews and questionnaire results on scholarly editions, 20 on text collections, and 5 on tools and environments.

In this GitHub branch, summaries of all the questionnaire data are published for each type of questionnaire. Please note that only those answers that are numerable are published. This includes (multiple-)choice questions but excludes free text commentaries, for example. Where the choice of an option was not compulsory or not relevant, the total number of answers may be lower than the total number of reviews. This is the case, for example, when a text collection has no graphical user interface, so that the questions about the user interface cannot be answered. On the other hand, the number of answers may be higher than the number of reviews for questions that allow for multiple answers.

The results are offered in two formats: XML/TEI and CSV.

For the data summaries see:
* [Data Summary Scholarly Editions](scholarly_editions)
* [Data Summary Text Collections](text_collections)
* [Data Summary Tools and Environments](tools)
