                        Collections (DTC) which is also the ninth volume in the entire RIDE series.
                        With this issue, we publish the last reviews that we received as a reaction

                        contributions. The current issue also represents a milestone for RIDE as a
                        whole: With the five reviews of the current issue, a total of 50 reviews are
                        now available in RIDE, including 20 on DTC and 30 on Digital Scholarly
                        Editions.</p>
                    <p>As in the previous volumes, the rationale of the reviews is based on the <ref

                        article is accompanied by a factsheet that summarises the most important
                        information on the resource evaluated. A selection of this data, gathered

                    <p>The current volume contains five reviews, two in English and three in German.
                        Three of the reviews in this volume are dedicated to linguistic corpora,
                        including Czech, Spanish, and multilingual resources. One review addresses a
                        collection of literary texts in English. The fifth review is devoted to a
                        collection of texts from a completely different context: Ancient Papyrology.
                        The reviewed resources are all DTCs that already look back on a longer
                        history of existence and development. The most recent of the resources
                        reviewed in this issue is <emph>Papyri.info</emph> which was still already
                        launched in 2010 and has been reviewed by Lucia Vannini.<note xml:id="ftn1"

                    <p>Looking at the diversity of content of all the DTCs reviewed in RIDE so far,
                        most reviews addressed resources from the fields of Literature and
                        Linguistics, followed by resources contributing to research in History.
                        There are more reviews on texts belonging to the early modern, modern, and
                        contemporary era than to the medieval or classical era. Regarding languages,
                        English and German texts are most common, but especially the multilingual
                        resources led to a broad language spectrum of the DTCs reviewed in RIDE so
                        far. As for the types of text, DTCs containing literary works have been
                        evaluated most often, followed by collections which include newspaper and
                        journal articles (see Fig. 1). When compared to the general trends, the
                        composition of the current issue reflects them quite well, with a special
                        focus on linguistic corpora. Despite the different contents and languages of
                        the resources examined, it is possible to have a comparative glance at the
                        DTCs of the current issue in terms of their history, methods and
                        practices.</p>

                    <head>Temporality</head>
                    <p>A recurring challenge in the evaluation of digital resources, which we have
                        also discussed in the <ref
                            target="https://ride.i-d-e.de/issues/issue-8/editorial/">editorial of
                            the previous issue on DTCs</ref>, is to take into account the
                        temporality of a digital resource on several levels when it is reviewed,
                        used, and evaluated. If older resources are no longer actively developed and
                        updated, they reflect a particular historical methodological state of the
                        art which may not bear comparison with similar resources which were created
                        later on. Nonetheless, they are still valuable, especially if they grew out
                        of major projects with a comprehensive goal and if they constitute
                        fundamental research which has not been repeated since then.</p>
                    <p>Regarding <emph>CORLEC</emph>, conceived as a reference corpus for
                        contemporary spoken Spanish, Betz states that it is still an important
                        resource for researchers interested in the field, despite its somewhat
                        outdated methods:<note xml:id="ftn6" n="6">Daniel Kozák evaluated <ref

                            meet today’s standard, the DTC is widely used in practice and therefore
                            deserves a positive overall evaluation.</note> “It must be anticipated
                        here that certain features and characteristics of <emph>CORLEC</emph>, which
                        are perceived as deficiencies today, met the standards or were even
                        innovative at the moment of its creation. Therefore, its comparability with
                        modern corpora in terms of composition and size are limited”.<note

                        Betz decides not to subject <emph>CORLEC</emph> to an evaluative comparison
                        with similar modern corpora, but to concentrate on its own characteristics.
                            <emph>Europarl</emph>, in contrast, has been updated several times since
                        it was first published in 2001 - its latest version dating from 2012, also
                        due to successive funding periods. Neuefeind explains that the corpus has
                        grown steadily with regards to the number of languages and words. In the
                        case of <emph>Europarl</emph>, all the different versions are still
                        accessible. Like <emph>CORLEC</emph>, also <emph>Europarl</emph> is still in
                        use: “Although this is an older corpus, it was prepared in a way that still
                        meets the usual standards for the creation of parallel corpora für machine
                        translation. The <emph>Europarl</emph> corpus is therefore still often used,
                        for example as a baseline or benchmark in the development and evaluation of
                        classical systems of statistical machine translation (SMT) [...]”.<note

                        evidenced by the fact that it is also included into other aggregated
                        corpora, for example <emph>InterCorp</emph>, reviewed in this same issue of
                        RIDE, where it is part of the so-called “collections”: texts integrated into
                        the core corpus from external resources. Such integration of external
                        sources, or more specifically the aggregation of various independent
                        resources is in itself a point worth of discussion, because it poses special
                        challenges for the editors and administrators of a resource, for its users
                        and also for reviewers.</p>

                    <p>When DTCs consist completely or partly of external resources, several
                        questions arise such as: When were different parts integrated into the
                        collection and how does this affect its integrity? How stable are the
                        sources of a collection over time? The last two questions are especially
                        relevant in the case of the Czech parallel corpus <emph>InterCorp</emph> and
                        papyrological portal <emph>Papyri.info</emph> which rely partly or entirely
                        on aggregated texts from external resources.</p>
                    <p><emph>InterCorp</emph> is partly based on aggregated resources, in that it
                        consists of a core corpus which has been manually aligned, and an extended
                        collection of aggregated pre-existing resources which have been
                        automatically aligned. In qualitative terms, the aggregated texts differ
                        from the corpus because of their automatic alignment. As such, according to
                        Kim, they have many more incorrect alignments.<note xml:id="ftn9" n="9">Cf.
                            Kim 2018, § 10, <ptr

                        addition, the metadata of the aggregated resources is often missing or
                        incomplete. <emph>Papyri.info</emph> deals with similar challenges. It is a
                        platform in which resources from several different origins are aggregated
                        and at the same time it offers a research environment for collaborative work
                        on the joined materials. Because of this, updates of the sources challenge
                        the synchronisation of the integrated resources and sometimes the
                        transparency of the data’s origin is jeopardized.<note xml:id="ftn10" n="10"
                            >In her review, Vannini describes how the update process on
                                <emph>Papyri.info</emph> is organized for those source collections
                            that still exist independently. On the other hand, one of the source
                            collections ceded to exist on its own when it was integrated into the
                            portal and yet another one still exists but its changes are not
                            reflected in <emph>Papyri.info</emph>. Cf. Vannini, § 11f., <ptr

                    <p>The described challenges are a strong case for the relevance of a review. In
                        the case of <emph>InterCorp</emph>, the reviewer learned about the problems
                        and peculiarities of aggregated resources through the resource’s own
                        documentation. For <emph>Papyri.info</emph> much of the information
                        regarding the state of the data and the update procedures was obtained by
                        the reviewer only through personal communication with those responsible for
                        the resource. For better transparency and reproducibility, however, it would
                        be helpful for users if this was documented on the website. Generally,
                        aggregated resources can be a complex set-up and the reviews can help to
                        disentangle the dependencies for a novice user.</p>

                        easily. However, all these questions always refer strongly to the textual
                        data, less to the tool as an independent research object, which in turn

                        further. Our first approach of a classification scheme was based on a
                        terminology relying primarily on the kinds of materials that are collected
                        in a resource (collection of literary texts, letters, historical documents,
                        inscriptions etc.) and the research aims of a collection (e.g. establishment
                        of a canon, comparison, evolution over time).<note xml:id="ftn16" n="16"
                            >Currently, the typology includes: General purpose collection, Corpus,
                            Collection of records, Canon, Complete works/œuvre, Reference corpus,
                            Contrastive corpus, Parallel corpus, and Diachronic corpus. Cf. <ptr

                            />.</note> Terminologies used by creators of DTCs and by scholars
                        discussing them pointed out other important factors for a classification
                        such as aspects of preserving, technical and presentational organization
                        (archive, library, database, portal). Still, the reviews on DTCs so far have
                        revealed that our current scheme of classification may not be enough to
                        capture significant nuances of different types of DTCs.</p>
                    <p>With the current issue, for example, it became clear to us that resources can
                        differ significantly in aspects with minor importance in traditional
                        taxonomies of DTCs, even if they usually are considered to be of the same
                        type. For instance, <emph>InterCorp</emph> and <emph>Europarl</emph> are
                        both parallel corpora by definition, but the resources differ in a
                        significant point: their research paradigm and their “target group”.
                            <emph>InterCorp</emph> was created in the first place as a
                        human-readable corpus. Kim stresses in her review that
                            “<emph>InterCorp</emph> [...] explicitly addresses human users and tries
                        to meet their needs.”<note xml:id="ftn17" n="17">“Das <emph>InterCorp</emph>
                            richtet sich [...] explizit an menschliche NutzerInnen und versucht

                        <emph>Europarl</emph>, on the other hand has “no dedicated user interface,
                        since <emph>Europarl</emph> is primarily meant to support research on
                        machine translation, which has to rely on parallel texts”, as Neuefeind
                            explains.<note xml:id="ftn18" n="18">Neuefeind 2018, abstract, <ptr
                                target="https://ride.i-d-e.de/issue-9/europarl/#abstract"/>.</note>
                        From a user’s and reviewer’s point of view, the quality of these two DTCs is
                        strikingly different which shows that kinds of interfaces, accessibility and
                        usage scenarios are aspects which also should be taken into account in a
                        typology of DTCs.</p>
                    <p>One possibility would be to identify and define DTCs on more levels but this
                        would certainly lead to a typology which is farther away from known
                        categories. Already now, reviewers tend to assign the resources to a range
                        of types which shows that the resources are either not easily classifiable,
                        that the categories are not very well-established, or that they may not be
                        easily integrated into a typological system. In the current issue, for
                        instance, Vannini identifies <emph>Papyri.info</emph> as “General purpose
                        collection”, “Corpus”, and “Reference corpus”<note xml:id="ftn19" n="19">Cf.
                                <ptr target="https://ride.i-d-e.de/issue-9/papyri-info/factsheet/"
                            />.</note> while Mahler identifies <emph>ShakespearePlaysPlus</emph> as
                        “Corpus”, “Canon”, and “Complete works”.<note xml:id="ftn20" n="20">Cf. <ptr
                                target="https://ride.i-d-e.de/issue-9/shakespeare-plays/factsheet/"
                            />.</note> Another approach would be to rethink the architecture of the
                        classification scheme as a whole. So far we built the typology “top-down” by
                        defining types of DTCs and assigning them characteristics. Thinking
                        “bottom-up”, types of DTCs would be build only by the combination of
                        characteristics. Such an approach where characteristics are not bound to
                        certain classes would probably be more suitable in the long term to
                        sufficiently capture all the nuances of DTCs which emerge in the still
                        growing and fast changing field of digital (text) technologies. It could
                        also make it easier for the reviewers to decide what characteristics a
                        resource has instead of assigning it to a predefined concept. It can be
                        assumed that such a bottom-up system based on many different characteristics
                        will lead to a “fine threaded carpet” of text collections with relations and
                        similarities on many different levels. Therefore, it seems reasonable to
                        combine both strategies and not to give up the idea of a typology
                        integrating existing categories entirely. Certainly, in the future we will
                        consider both options and evaluate modifications of our taxonomy.</p>

                        excellent empirical basis for digging into the ground of digital scholarship

                        as its contribution to the critical discourse on digital scholarly
