            <p>This is a review of the <emph>Fleischmann Diaries Online Archive</emph>, a
               digitisation project including a transcription of Aloys Fleischmann Jr’s diaries
               written in 1926 and 1927, as well as over 200 images from the Fleischmann family
               albums. These materials represent an important piece of Irish cultural heritage.
               Given the enormity of the task, which was accomplished in one year, the editor has
               created a beautiful piece of work. As it stands now, this project represents a
               digital archive with some elements of a digital edition. However, key improvements
               can still be made to increase this project’s usefulness as a scholarly resource, such
               as increased integration of the editor's related master thesis into the website,
               enhanced metadata of images and facsimiles, the integration of a search engine, and
               links with Aloys Fleischmann’s compositions, as well as recordings of referenced
               performances.</p>

            <p xml:id="p1">German-born Irish composer Aloys Fleischmann Jr (1910-1992) was a
               professor of Music at University College Cork from 1934 to 1980, as well as the
               founder and conductor of the Cork Symphony Orchestra from 1934 until his death. His
               contributions to the teaching and proliferation of Irish music were profound: In
               addition to serving as composer for the Cork Ballet Company and chairing the Cork
               Sculpture Park, he also founded the University Art Society (1930), the Music
               Teacher’s Association (1935), the Cork Orchestral Society (1938), and the Cork
               International Choral Festival (1954). He is justly described as a key figure in the
               patronage of all artistry in Cork (<emph>Cork’s great music family</emph>).</p>
            <p xml:id="p2">As a teenager Fleischmann wrote two diaries, one in 1926 and one in 1927
               (340 pages and 50 pages, respectively) about his daily life in Ireland. Throughout
               the two diaries, Fleischmann describes in detail his attempts at musical composition,
               his courses at school, his interactions with local musicians, artists, teachers,
               friends, religious and political figures, as well as the work of his Bavarian-born
               father and Irish-born mother, Aloys Sr and Tilly Fleischmann (née Swertz), who were
               also musicians. The diaries further provide a description of the immigrant experience
               in Ireland in the early years of the Irish Free State, a phenomenon that evidently
               had a deep impact on Fleischmann as he grew older. Fleischmann reflects on the
               political situation in Ireland and on the European continent. The diaries leave the
               reader with the impression of Fleischmann as a conscientious, intelligent young man
               who is aware of the value his diary presents as a record of private and public life
               in Ireland.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3">The digitisation and creation of the Fleischmann Diaries Online Archive
               was carried out in 2012-2013 as part of Roísín O’Brien’s master’s degree in Digital
               Arts and Humanities at University College Cork. Conceived as a ‘how-to’ guide for
               digitisers, the online archive accompanies O’Brien’s dissertation, <emph>Digitising
                  the Diaries of Aloys Fleischmann: a prototype for novices </emph>(O’Brien 2013a).
               Both are published under a CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license. The website for the digital
               archive was designed and supported using the Wordpress blogging platform and a
               purchased Wordpress theme, with additional Wordpress plug-ins installed by O’Brien.
               This is the first published edition of facsimiles and notes of these two diaries in
               digital form. As such, they add a significant new resource to scholars of Aloys
               Fleischmann Jr and to those studying the revival of Irish cultural heritage and music
               during the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century.</p>
         </div>
         <div xml:id="div2">
            <head>Selection</head>
            <p xml:id="p4">With only one year to complete the project, O’Brien needed a corpus for
               her dissertation that was both limited in scope and still relevant to her
               institution. O’Brien points out that the two Fleischmann diaries were primarily
               selected because of their specific significance to University College Cork, which,
               under the direction of university archivist Catriona Mulcahy, houses the Fleischmann
               Collection, a physical repository of the Fleischmann family’s materials (O’Brien
               2013a 9). Though it is not made clear on the website, a close reading of the
               dissertation shows that these were the only two diaries written by Fleischmann, and
               are therefore a new and unique choice for digitisation (O’Brien 2013a 31).</p>
            <p xml:id="p5">The ‘Introduction’ page, beautifully written by Dr Ruth Fleischmann, the
               eldest daughter of Aloys Fleischmann Jr and author of multiple texts on the
               Fleischmann family, states that the two diaries selected for digitisation represent
               ‘the sources of [Aloys Fleischmann Jr’s] dedicated commitment to the cause of the
               arts in Ireland’, and serve as the impetus for his substantial, life-long promotion
               of Irish music in particular: ‘The 1926 diary reveals that Aloys’ decision to make
               music his profession was taken in the summer of that year [...]. The diaries provide
               material that explains his choice. Many entries document his pleasure at the music he
               grew up with: his father at the harmonium preparing for cathedral services, his
               mother practicing works of the classical and modern repertoire for her piano
               recitals’ (Fleischmann 2013).</p>
         </div>
         <div xml:id="div3">
            <head>Content</head>
            <p xml:id="p6">The online archive consists of high-resolution color JPEG images of each
               page (originally shot in raw format with a Nikon D5200 and an 18-55 mm lens;
               f/3.5-5.6) and transcriptions presented side by side in a fixed, ‘page-by-page’ view.
               However, options to zoom, rotate, or otherwise manipulate the images are not
               available, and there is no complete zip file of raw or TIFF images available for
               download (though the JPEGs can be individually downloaded with the normal browser
               functions). O’Brien notes that this approach was intentional: ‘The replication of the
               artefact’s non-digital physicality was envisioned as the first layer of creating an
               aura’ (O’Brien 2013a 14). Fleischmann Jr’s handwriting is quite clear, which makes
               the artefact (mostly) easy to read without the accompanying transcription. O’Brien
               did note that lighting presented an issue in the digitisation process, but the pages
               of the diary are still somewhat dark, forcing the user to brighten the entire screen
               in order to read from the images directly (O’Brien 2013a 52).</p>
            <p xml:id="p7">O’Brien also made use of the Wordpress ‘Footnotes’ plug-in, which comes
               with a hover-over and a ‘back arrow’ function allowing users to jump back to the line
               previously stopped at to read the footnote. Some diary entries include footnotes that
               explain places or persons mentioned in the diary. However, in many cases these
               footnotes contain references to other websites. These references are not hyperlinks
               and hence cannot be used to navigate to the referred website; it is unclear whether
               this was an editorial choice or a restriction of the Wordpress plug-in.</p>
            <p xml:id="p8">The archive also includes a curated gallery of about 200 images taken
               from Tilly Fleischmann’s family album held by the Fleischmann Collection at
               University College Cork. These images provide pictures of places and people mentioned
               in the diaries. There are three distinct image galleries: ‘Glimpses of Aloys
               Fleischmann’s life through family albums’, ‘1926 Gallery’, and ‘1927 Gallery’
               (O’Brien 2013b ‘Gallery 2’). The photographs in the 1926 Gallery lack basic metadata,
               and there are no links to diary entries where specific characters are mentioned,
               making it difficult to transition back and forth between persons mentioned in the
               diaries and the photos themselves. Links to and from the images as well as simple
               metadata would resolve this issue.</p>
            <p xml:id="p9">Instead of a separate ‘Credits’ page, the individual work of the site’s
               contributors is noted on ‘The Digitisation Process’ page, available from the
               drop-down menu ‘Project Information.’ Dr Ruth Fleischmann created transcriptions,
               annotations and indices of the diaries (Fleischmann 2010). TEI P5 guidelines were
               used to, in O’Brien’s words, ‘lightly encode’ the 1927 diary only, and no reason is
               stated on the website as to why these standards were not applied to the 1926 diary
               (O’Brien 2013b ‘The Digitisation Process’). Dr Fleischmann also provided substantial
               background information in the ‘Introduction’ page of the site about the role the
               Fleischmann family has played in invigorating Irish musical heritage in Cork. Max
               Fleischmann, grandson of Fleischmann Jr, digitised the 1927 materials, and Roísín
               O’Brien carried out the digitisation of all of the 1926 materials. The website is
               hosted by University College Cork and is maintained by the Webmaster of the
               Electronic Publishing Unit, Peter Flynn. In the ‘Digitisation Process’ page, O’Brien
               notes her plans to update the site continually. Server support at UCC for the master
               files of the project was ‘only available for the duration of the Masters Degree
               project […] as there is no recognized facility for the long-term preservation of
               data’, so O’Brien is now making use of the Cork Open Research Archive, or CORA, for
               an archive of her master files as well as the published dissertation (O’Brien 2013a
               62).</p>
            <p xml:id="p10">The XML transcriptions are available as separate downloads at the bottom
               of the ‘Digitisation Process’ page. Making these files more visible would enhance the
               value of the resource and make it easier for researchers to analyze the editing
               choices used for the encoding, especially as this justification was not provided in
               the dissertation or on the website. Another issue is that the XML transcriptions can
               only be downloaded from the Dropbox service as single files for each diary. This
               increases the potential for problems with the availability of these important files.
               As a general rule, it is always advisable to keep the number of different services as
               low as possible, and since the project’s master files are stored on the CORA server
               anyway, it is hard to see why the XML transcriptions are not stored on this server,
               too. Also, a simple internet search proved that the transcriptions of the diaries by
               Dr Ruth Fleischmann are available in PDF format from the Cork City Central Library
               website (Fleischmann 2010), but are not available from the Fleischmann Diaries Online
               Archive.</p>
            <p xml:id="p11">As well as lacking a bibliography for information mentioned in the
               introduction and the annotations, the site also lacks links to Fleischmann Jr’s
               music, previously published materials or other digital collections related to his
               work or the legacy of his music in Ireland. If O’Brien intends to continue expanding
               and improving the website, this could provide an area for future consideration, as
               these collections do exist, most notably in the form of the <ref
                  target="http://www.corkcitylibraries.ie/fleischmann100/">Cork City</ref>
               <ref target="http://www.corkcitylibraries.ie/fleischmann100/">Central</ref>
               <ref target="http://www.corkcitylibraries.ie/fleischmann100/">Library's</ref>
               <ref target="http://www.corkcitylibraries.ie/fleischmann100/">Aloys Fleischmann
                  website</ref>. The only link to the Cork City Libraries website is in the
               ‘Contact’ page (where it is used as the way to contact the Fleischmann family),
               though it seems fitting to provide this link on the ‘Digitisation Process’ page as
               well. This site in particular would be a useful resource to link to from the
               Fleischmann Diaries Online Archive because it is the largest digitisation effort of
               Fleischmann materials to date and is co-authored by Dr Ruth Fleischmann. Several
               recordings of Fleischmann’s music are also freely available from the Irish Composer’s
               Project, a digital archive designed and housed by the <ref
                  target="http://cmc.ie/composers/digi_works.cfm?composerID=44">Contemporary Music
                  Center of Ireland’s website</ref>. </p>
         </div>
         <div xml:id="div4">
            <head>Aims and objectives</head>
            <p xml:id="p12">The ‘About’ page of the website (available under the drop-down menu
               labeled ‘Project Information’) describes the objective of the archive as ‘a freely
               available digitisation prototype for scholars and non-practitioners, providing them
               with a reproducible model.’ This page goes on to state that ‘future expansion will
               consist of metadata development, which will transform the site into an enhanced
               scholarly resource.’ Further clarification is provided by O’Brien’s dissertation, to
               which a link is provided on the website from the same drop-down menu under the title
               ‘Dissertation,’ and which outlines the specific aim as the development of ‘a toolbox
               of methods for electronic reproduction by an individual’ (O’Brien 2013a 7). As such,
               the page entitled ‘The Digitisation Process’ explains the procedures for researchers
               interested in creating a similar project.</p>
            <p xml:id="p13">Given that the mission of the site was to provide a ‘reproducible
               model’, it is surprising that more of the content and objectives outlined in the
               dissertation did not find their way into the online archive. Indeed, O’Brien’s
               discussion of the role of an online archive in ‘closing the gap between private and
               public space and placing the content in a social context’ is a thoughtful one, and
               would be a welcome addition to the ‘Introduction’ or ‘About’ page (O’Brien 2013a
               59-60). Also lacking on the website is a justification of the digitisation
               methodology, which is described to some extent in the dissertation itself.</p>
            <p xml:id="p14">In her dissertation, O’Brien notes that the roles and responsibilities
               with regard to workflow developed organically over time (O’Brien 2013a 18-20).
               However, neither a description of these practices nor an analysis of their success or
               failure is mentioned in the online archive at all. The development of a community of
               practice, in which each member completes specific tasks, is an integral part of any
               scholarly digital edition. It provides context not only for the selection of
               materials, but also for the selection of contributors. This gives the user a specific
               sense of the value and expertise each contributor brings to the project – something
               this edition lacks.</p>
            <p xml:id="p15">What is enlightening to see is the collaborative efforts of Dr Ruth
               Fleischmann and Roísín O’Brien to engage in a critical digitisation process of the
               photographs included in the online archive. In contrast to including every picture
               from Tilly Fleischmann’s family albums, pictures were curated to provide specific
               meaning and context to the diaries. A discussion of this selection would be a welcome
               addition to the ‘Digitisation Process’ page. By carefully selecting images based on
               their relevance to the project, Fleischmann and O’Brien were able to save time and
               financial resources while still achieving an engaging and helpful collection. These
               photographs, as stated above, could benefit from more enhanced metadata, but as of
               now they do still provide visual texture to the diaries.</p>
         </div>
         <div xml:id="div5">
            <head>Presentation</head>
            <p xml:id="p16">The purchased Wordpress theme is clean and beautiful: a simple color
               scheme of red, white, grey and black prevents the pages from looking too busy. As
               O’Brien states in her dissertation, the design and visual organization of the
               Fleischmann archive is based on the <ref target="http://dh.tcd.ie/martindiary/">Diary
                  of Mary Martin project at Trinity College Dublin</ref> and the <ref
                  target="http://graves.uvic.ca/graves/site/index.xml">Robert Graves Diaries at the
                  University of Victoria</ref> (O’Brien 2013a 25). What is missing is a discussion
               about how the XML was transformed for the web view. This information is invaluable
               for researchers attempting to replicate the steps of the project, so it is crucial
               for O’Brien to consider adding this information to the ‘Digitisation Process’
               page.</p>
            <p xml:id="p17">The diaries are broken down by year and then by month, making browsing
               easy. However, the visual layout of the index is somewhat overwhelming, as it is
               presented horizontally rather than vertically, in small grey script, and without the
               benefit of parsing by attributes such as places, people, and events. These additions
               would make the indices much easier to navigate.</p>
            <p xml:id="p18">The licensing and copyright information is noted at the bottom of every
               page, and the drop-down menus are, for the most part, well organized and easy to
               navigate. A separate page for ‘Alternate Formats’, including the XML transcriptions
               and a sitemap would be appreciated, as would a simple search engine for the site. The
               presence of an ‘Acknowledgments’ page makes the reader look for credits, so some
               clarification, perhaps in the presence of a separate ‘Credits’ page would be useful
               for scholars, and a standard addition for those looking to use this source as a
               reproducible model.</p>
            <p xml:id="p19">As mentioned above, one feature that could enhance the value of this
               project for scholarly use would be a focus on linking this site with others of a
               similar nature (some of which have been previously mentioned). The ability to listen
               to the music of Fleischmann, as well as the music that inspired him, by clicking on a
               pop-up link would enhance the interactivity of the site. As stated above, many such
               audio files are freely and publicly available. A ‘Further Reading’ page might also
               facilitate further engagement with the material, and would promote the linking of the
               Fleischmann Diaries Online Archive with other, similar resources. </p>
            <p xml:id="p20">It is clear from the intentions outlined in the ‘About’ page, the
               ‘Digitisation Process’ page, and O’Brien’s dissertation that further developments,
               particularly concerning metadata, are being considered for this project. With the
               focus on digital preservation outlined in the dissertation, it is evident that
               O’Brien at the very least intends to keep the site viable as a scholarly resource for
               those who wish to use the materials in their facsimile form (even without enhanced
               transcriptions or footnotes). However, the choice of the Wordpress platform may
               present future issues with the long-term preservation of the materials. O’Brien notes
               that ‘[e]ach Fleischmann digital image and transcription was uploaded individually to
               the portfolio section of the Wordpress dashboard and published’ (O’Brien 2013a 63).
               This presents a problem: if there is a breakdown within the Wordpress image
               repository itself, the integration of the images into the website might break down,
               in which case each file would have to be manually uploaded and inserted into the
               right place again. O’Brien might, therefore, consider other more stable platforms for
               digital dissemination of the archive.</p>

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="p21">While the Fleischmann Diaries Online Archive provides a new resource for
               scholars in the form of Aloys Fleischmann Jr’s 1926 and 1927 diary facsimiles and
               transcriptions, it is somewhat difficult to identify the website as either an online
               archive or a scholarly digital edition. I would venture to determine that, at the
               moment, it is an online archive with some elements of a digital edition. Although it
               provides critical engagement with the corpus, the project lacks easily accessible
               documentation of the textual tradition chosen, as well as transparency of the
               editorial decisions made (such as the decision to encode the 1927 diary, but not the
               1926 diary). Further, the website does not include a bibliography for the footnotes
               provided, and does not adequately situate itself or its corpus in the historiography
               of other, similar resources. The website is promoted as a digital
                  <emph>archive</emph>, specifically setting out to provide a digital preservation
               prototype for digitisers, and not for scholarly editors – at least not yet. The
               encoding of the 1927 diary, as well as its facsimiles and explanatory footnotes, make
               it possible, though, to see this project as a digital scholarly edition. However,
               several improvements must be made in order for this archive to be equally useful to
               scholarly editors and digitisers. </p>
            <p xml:id="p22">As a prototype for digitisers, the online archive is largely successful.
               Overall, it is easy to use, and the digital imaging is of very high quality. The
               clean functionality of the Wordpress theme places the artefacts as the highlights of
               the archive. It is clear that considerable care went into the planning stages of the
               digitisation, as is evidenced by the extensive discussion in the accompanying
               dissertation. Increased integration of the dissertation text into the site is
               necessary for practitioners; at present one must endure jumping back and forth
               between the downloaded dissertation and the website in order to elucidate points not
               mentioned in the online archive.</p>
            <p xml:id="p23">In short, my main suggestions for improvement are as follows: <list
                  rend="bulleted">
                  <item>More integration of the dissertation text into the website.</item>
                  <item>Increased focus on the decisions made in the image selection process.</item>
                  <item>Theoretical basis for the encoding of the 1927 diary, and encoding of the
                     1926 diary. </item>
                  <item>Editing the layout of the indices to make them more user-friendly.</item>
                  <item>Increased links between footnotes and gallery images.</item>
                  <item>A search engine.</item>
                  <item>An image-viewer with zoom functionality.</item>
                  <item>Metadata improvements for images as well as the diaries themselves.</item>
                  <item>A separate ‘Alternate Formats’ page with XML files, a sitemap, and more
                     information about the technical architecture of the website, including how and
                     by whom the XML was transformed for the web view.</item>
                  <item>Links or embedding of audio clips of Aloys Fleischmann Jr’s music to
                     increase context.</item>
                  <item>A visualization of relationships between key players in the diaries.</item>
               </list> With these improvements, the Fleischmann Diaries Online Archive has the
               potential to become a distinct, key resource for scholars of 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               century Irish cultural heritage, with material independent from previously available
               digital collections.<note xml:id="ftn1">The research leading to these results has
