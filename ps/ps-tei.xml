            <p>The project <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> (2012–2017) was
                aimed at the collection, edition, and analysis of Spanish and Portuguese private

                presented on the project website. <emph>P. S.</emph><emph>
                    Post Scriptum</emph> can be classified both as a scholarly edition and a
                diachronic linguistic corpus and can be considered pioneer work in combining
                procedures from textual criticism together with the linguistic preparation of the
                corpus, serving the needs of both historians and linguists. Valuable basic work has
                been done in encoding approximately 5,000 letters which can be downloaded in
                different formats on the website. Only an open licence for reuse of the data remains
                desirable and at times the project could have benefitted from an even more

            <p>In the <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> project, private
                letters written in Spain and Portugal between the 16th and the early 19th century
                were collected, edited, and analyzed. Almost all of the letters were previously
                unpublished, so a digital collection and edition of them was one of the main goals
                of the project. Another priority was the historical and linguistic study of the
                letters in this diachronic corpus. The <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> project was
                funded with an ERC Grant between 2012 and 2017 and was hosted at the faculty of arts
                and humanities of the University of Lisbon.<note xml:id="ftn1" n="1">For more information about the EU-funded project see “P. S.” <emph>CORDIS. Community Research and Development Information Service.</emph> Last

                    history of these languages in the Early Modern period. Its focus is therefore on
                    general philological aspects of the text collection and edition as well as
                    characteristics relevant to the field of digital humanities.</note></p>

                <p>The letters edited in <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>
                    are private correspondence written by people of different ages, gender,
                    occupation, and from different social backgrounds. Most of them survived because
                    they were used as evidence in civil, military, ecclesiastical, and inquisitorial
                    courts and preserved in the corresponding archives. The letters served as proofs
                    to convict or absolve their senders, recipients, or persons mentioned in them,
                    and were often accompanied by transcriptions of hearings of witnesses and
                    defendants. Both kinds of materials are of special documental value for the
                    study of everyday history and the history of language, as many everyday issues
                    are covered in the letters and transcripts and presented in a register<note xml:id="ftn3" n="3">A form of language used for a particular

                <p>The collection and edition of private letters of this kind has
                    been at the heart of two predecessor projects closely related to <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>. The project <emph>CARDS
                        Unknown Letters</emph> started in 2007 and was aimed at the online edition and
                    study of Portuguese private letters written between 1500 and 1900.<note xml:id="ftn6" n="6">A description of this project, which was
                        sponsored by the national Portuguese funding institution FCT, can be found
                        on the website of the Linguistics Centre of the University of Lisbon (Cf.
                        “CARDS - Unknown Letters.” <emph>Centro de Linguística da
                            Universidade de Lisboa</emph>. 2018. <ptr target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180602131349/http:/www.clul.ulisboa.pt/en/researchers/10-research/705-cards-unknown-letters"/>),
                        but an individual website for the CARDS project is not accessible anymore,
                        since it segued into the <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> project
                        (all the links that the reviewer found are redirected to the P. S. project
                        website).</note> The second related project started in 2010 and is called
                        <emph>FLY Forgotten Letters, Years 1900-1974</emph>, or <emph>FLY Cartas Esquecidas</emph> in Portuguese. It has an online
                    presence at <ptr target="http://fly.clul.ul.pt/"/>.<note xml:id="ftn7" n="7">General information about the FLY project
                        can also be found at “FLY - Forgotten Letters 1900-1974.” <emph>Centro de Linguística da Universidade de Lisboa</emph>. 2018. <ptr target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180602151532/http:/www.clul.ulisboa.pt/en/10-research/703-fly-1900-1974"/>. There is
                        also an umbrella page for all three projects. See <ptr target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180603133455/http:/cards-fly.clul.ul.pt/"/>.</note> The
                    letters of FLY were written in the 20th century, in the context of war,
                    migration, imprisonment, and exile. Both the predecessor projects and <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> were carried out at the Linguistics
                    Department of the University of Lisbon, the latter starting in 2012. While
                    dealing with letters from different periods of time and contexts, and
                    transmitted in different ways, the general goals of the projects CARDS and FLY
                    were the same and also the methodology was shared. The approaches developed in
                    the precursor projects were in principle continued in <emph>P. S.
                        Post Scriptum</emph>, but with a different linguistic and regional scope. In
                        <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>, the corpus was extended to also
                    include letters from Spain from the Early Modern period. In addition, it was
                    announced that further types of linguistic annotation were to be added.<note xml:id="ftn8" n="8">Cf. Gomes et al. 2011.</note> In this
                    review, only the results of the <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>
                    project are discussed.<note xml:id="ftn9" n="9">The results
                        published on the FLY website will only be taken into account occasionally,
                        where they reveal shifts in the methodology and publication strategy when
                        compared to <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>.</note></p>
                <p>The goals of <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> are described on the
                    homepage of the project website as follows:
                    <quote><p>“Within the P. S. (Post Scriptum) Project, systematic research will be developed,
                        along with the publishing and historical-linguistic study of private letters
                        written in Portugal and Spain along the Early Modern Ages. These documents are
                        almost all unpublished epistolary writings made by authors from different social
                        backgrounds. [...] These textual resources often present an (almost) oral
                        rhetoric, treating everyday issues of past centuries in a register that hasn't
                        been easy to study, apart from brief examples. Not only does the P. S. Project
                        present a wide collection of private letters, but it also makes it available as
                        a scholarly digital edition and as an annotated corpus.”</p>
                        <ref>“Project P. S. Post Scriptum.” CLUL 2014. <ptr target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180602124555/http:/ps.clul.ul.pt/"/>.</ref></quote>
                </p>
                <p>What is highlighted here is the relevance of collecting and
                    publishing historical sources that were previously inaccessible to a wider
                    audience, but also their value for the diachronic study of language registers
                    that are rarely documented otherwise. Especially noteworthy is the double goal
                    set for this digital text collection: it is conceived as a scholarly digital
                    edition, but also as a linguistic corpus. This broad scope is reflected in the
                    conception of <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> as an inherently
                    interdisciplinary project with a team of linguists and historians from Spain and
                    Portugal. The “Credits” page, which lists members of <emph>P. S.
                        Post Scriptum</emph> as well as of the CARDS project<note xml:id="ftn10" n="10">For someone not familiar with the history of the
                        projects, it can be confusing that the credits list is divided into two
                        parts and that it mentions the CARDS project at all. It would be helpful to
                        include a brief explanation of the relationship between the two projects
                        into the website to make it self-contained, because currently this
                        information cannot be found on the credits page, nor anywhere else on the
                            <emph>P. S. </emph><emph>Post Scriptum</emph>
                        website.</note>, shows the range of fields involved: historical and
                    computational linguists, a teaching researcher, members responsible for
                    linguistic, historiographic, and paleographic survey, experts in digital
                    scholarly editing, conceptionists, and programmers.<note xml:id="ftn11" n="11">“Credits.” CLUL 2014. <ptr target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180602160832/http:/ps.clul.ul.pt/index.php?action=ficha"/>.</note></p>
                <p>Because of its double goal, <emph>P. S. Post
                        Scriptum</emph> should be reviewed as both a scholarly digital edition and a
                    linguistic corpus. This project is one of many that don’t easily fit into a
                    taxonomy of scholarly digital resources.<note xml:id="ftn12" n="12">This review therefore draws on both catalogues of criteria developed
                        by the IDE, the <emph>Criteria for Reviewing Scholarly Digital
                            Editions </emph>(<ptr target="http://www.i-d-e.de/publikationen/weitereschriften/criteria-version-1-1/"/>. Accessed June 1, 2018) and the <emph>Criteria for Reviewing
                            Digital Text Collections</emph> (<ptr target="https://www.i-d-e.de/publikationen/weitereschriften/criteria-text-collections-version-1-0/"/>. Accessed June 1, 2018), the latter including criteria for the assessment
                        of linguistic corpora. Because the review is published in an issue on
                        scholarly digital editions, the accompanying factsheet is only about
                        editorial aspects, though. Interestingly, <emph>P. S. Post
                            Scriptum</emph> labels itself “A Digital Archive”, avoiding the terms
                        “edition” and “corpus” and placing the focus on the organizational,
                        institutional, and preservational dimension instead of the methodological
                        orientation of the selection and treatment of documents and texts. Similar
                        observations are made for other digital resources in the editorial of RIDE
                        6. Cf. Henny-Krahmer and Neuber 2017.</note> It is very laudable that the
                    letters in <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> are edited critically in
                    order to lay the foundation for research in various disciplines. The project
                    members themselves reflect their multidisciplinary approach:

                        philologist and the historian are not exploited by the linguist in the same
                        manner that an annotated corpus would be; and vice versa, the linguistic

                <p>Vaamonde sees the new technologies as a type of catalyst fostering
                    the development of tools that are useful to various humanities disciplines and
                    at the same time making a lack of such tools visible. A similar spirit of
                    disciplinary reunification emerging from the digital humanities is formulated by
                    Marquilhas and Hendrickx:<quote><p>Admittedly, the division of the philological method in the past primarily served

                    respectively demanded. Now the adoption of digital methods and the creation of
                    resources led to a situation where the “walls” between these areas began to
                    fall, in an exemplary dynamic of interdisciplinarity.</p><ref>Marquilhas and Hendrickx 2016.<note xml:id="ftn14" n="14">Translated from

                <p>Taking these statements of the project members into account, <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> aims to provide fundamental research
                    for the digital humanities as a whole and not just to serve the needs of a
                    single discipline. In this review, <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> is
                    thus examined from various perspectives. First, the general structure and
                    contents of the project website are discussed. Following this, the general
                    parameters of <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> as a digital text
                    collection are reviewed: the principles of selection of documents and texts, the
                    organization and accessibility of the materials, available metadata and
                    documentation. <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> is then assessed as a
                    scholarly digital edition on the one hand and as a linguistic corpus on the
                    other. Finally, the long-term prospects of the entire resource are
                    evaluated.</p>

                <head>Website</head>
                <p>The website of <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> is available in three languages:
                    Portuguese, English – the default, and Spanish. What is translated are the main
                    menu, headings and introductory texts on single pages, and search options,
                    except the XPath options and predefined queries for a syntactic search which are
                    only presented in English. Even the metadata for the letters are partially
                    translated. The metadata categories are available in the three languages. For
                    the metadata values, the language of the letter seems to determine their main
                        language.<note xml:id="ftn15" n="15">No documentation was
                            found on this aspect of the resource.In the XML files of the letters only the language of translations is marked but the metadata language is not indicated with a language attribute (@xml:lang). Only the language of translations is marked.</note> The letter
                    written from María de Espinosa to her husband, for example, is in Spanish, so
                    the summary, context information, etc. are also given in Spanish. That the
                    metadata is in different languages may complicate a machine-based reuse of the
                    data. Still, the summary and context information of each letter can be switched
                    to English.<note xml:id="ftn16" n="16">Once there, the only way to
                        get back to the original language version is the back button of the browser.
                        It would have been nice to also have a button to switch the metadata
                        language back, but this is just a small inconvenience.</note> In some cases,
                    even the text of the letters themselves is translated. Where this is not the
                    case, a hint is given on how to proceed for automatic translation
                        elsewhere.<note xml:id="ftn17" n="17">“If there is no
                        translation for the letter itself, you may copy the text (while using the
                        view 'Standardization') and paste it to an automatic translator of your
                        choice.” “1553. Carta de María de Espinosa para su esposo Francisco de

                    no way to search for translated letters, so they can only be found by chance and
                    it is also not possible to find out how many of them have been translated.<note xml:id="ftn18" n="18">See “1756. Carta de José da Costa

                    metadata and text are not directly linked to the main language option of the
                    website, so it is for example possible to have the website in Portuguese and
                    read a letter in English. It is comfortable that the main language can be
                    switched on every subpage of the site and not only from the homepage. All in
                    all, much effort has been put into translations to make the site accessible to
                    readers from Portugal and Spain as well as to an international audience.</p>

                <p>The structure of the website is straightforward. On the homepage,
                    an introductory text about the project, its goals and the methodologies used, is
                    given (see Fig. 2). Links to documentation are also placed on the homepage and
                    there is a suggestion for how to cite the whole resource, but there are no
                    citation suggestions for individual subpages. The main menu of the website is
                    placed on the left, is visible on all subpages, and has a single level of
                    entries, making it easy to stay oriented on the website. The first half of the menu
                    entries comprises content-related aspects: “Search”, “Participants” and “Map”
                    are all general access points to the letters, followed by the entry “Tree
                    Search” which constitutes an advanced option. The second half of the menu is
                    devoted to project-related information such as “Credits” and “Related Projects”,
                    and to project outcomes other than the presentation of the letters on the
                    website (“Papers” and “Downloads”). The website seems to have a backend<note xml:id="ftn19" n="19">Here, “backend” is understood as a
                        non-public part of the website.</note>, as there is a link to a login. As
                    this is not explained further, it is not clear for whom this option has been
                    designed and how it can be used. Regarding the structure of the website, there
                    are a few subpages that cannot be reached directly from the main menu. These are
                    the letters themselves (discussed further below), a “Word Distribution”

                    seems to be linked to from the help section of the general search page.</p>
                <p>On the page “Related Projects”, a list of links is given which is
                    divided into four categories: “Tools”, “Digital Editions and Historical
                    Corpora”, “Guidelines and tutorials”, and “Networks and Associations”.<note xml:id="ftn22" n="22">Cf. “Related Projects.” CLUL 2014. <ptr target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180603143435/http:/ps.clul.ul.pt/en/index.php?action=links"/>.</note>
                    While this is an interesting list, some explanation would have been helpful to
                    know in what way the listed “projects” are related to <emph>P. S.
                        Post Scriptum</emph>. The mentioned tools (TEITOK, eDictor, CorpusSearch) have
                    probably been used in the project. It is likely that the project is a member of
                    the associations listed (AHDig and REDaiep). But why is the <emph>Digital Archive of Letters written by Flemish authors and composers</emph>
                    listed under “Guidelines and tutorials” and in what way is the tutorial “Text
                    Processing with Linux” relevant for users of the <emph>P. S. Post
                        Scriptum</emph> website? Also for the “Digital Editions and Historical
                    Corpora”, the relationship between <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>
                    and these other projects is not clear. The predecessor project FLY is listed,
                    but also for example the Mark Twain Project which has probably inspired the
                    methodology of <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> in terms of a digital
                    scholarly edition of letters. Another project mentioned is <emph>"En
                        el ojo del huracá</emph><emph>n": Cartas de Ultramar a España,
                        1823 - Edición digital</emph>. The homepage of that project explains that a
                    cooperation between <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> and TEITOK has
                    been established and that the 65 letters of the edition have a second user
                    interface at the Linguistics Centre of the University of Lisbon.<note xml:id="ftn23" n="23">See Stangl n.d. and <emph>Ultramar</emph>. 2014. <ptr target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180603144610/http:/cards-fly.clul.ul.pt/teitok/ultramar/"/>.</note> As
                    can be seen, there are various reasons for projects to appear on the “Related
                    Projects” page and a few subheadings or sentences would have helped to clarify
                    the relationships.</p>
                <p>The “Papers” subpage lists publications by type (Books,
                    Guidelines, Book Sections, Journal Articles, Conferences) and by year
                        (2012-2017).<note xml:id="ftn24" n="24">Cf. “Publicações /

                    The number of publications produced by the <emph>P. S. Post

                    22 journal articles, and 64 conference papers contributing to various fields

                    <p><emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> can be classified
                        as a primary source collection because it includes descriptions and digital
                        facsimiles of the documents, and as a diachronic corpus because it brings
                        together letters from Spain and Portugal from the 16th up to the 19th
                        century. Unfortunately, there is no information on the website about the
                        overall number of letters included in the archive and of the distribution of
                        the letters over time. On the word distribution page, some statistics are
                        given in numbers of words (by language, gender, and social status). The
                        number of words is almost balanced for letters in Spanish and Portuguese
                        (984,830 and 974,391 words, respectively).<note xml:id="ftn25" n="25">Cf. “Word distribution.” CLUL 2014. <ptr target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180603155606/http:/ps.clul.ul.pt/index.php?action=cqp&amp;act=distribute"/>.</note>
                        The linguistic focus of the project is illustrated by the fact that the size
                        is measured in “words” instead of “documents” or “texts”. A way to get to
                        the number of letters is to use the search functions: there are 2,369
                        letters in Portuguese and 2,446 in Spanish which makes a total of 4,815
                        letters. A search by year also reveals that the earliest letter in the
                        collection dates from 1500 and the latest letters from the 1830s. It would
                        have been easy to provide some general numbers on the homepage or another
                        page of the website to provide the user with a first impression about the
                        size and composition of the corpus. Despite the word counts on the word
                        distribution page, no overview of the temporal distribution of letters is
                        given which would be an important information for a diachronic corpus.
                        Interestingly, the homepage of the predecessor project FLY includes exactly
                        this: a detailed overview of the sample in the form of a descriptive text
                        and tables (see Fig. 3). A similar summary is desirable for <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>.</p>
                    
                    <p>On the website itself, no information is given about the
                        selection criteria for the letters. More information can be found in some of
                        the publications presenting the project, but this is not ideal, for several
                        reasons. First, a user of the website is forced to go through the list of
                        publications and look for those which are concerned with the presentation of
                        the project as a whole. In the case of <emph>P. S. Post
                            Scriptum</emph>, the project descriptions tend to focus either on the
                        Portuguese or on the Spanish subcorpus, depending on the context of the
                        publication, which makes it harder to get information about the whole
                            collection.<note xml:id="ftn26" n="26">These are most
                            probably: Gomes et al. 2012, Marquilhas 2012 (about the Portuguese

                            2015a, Vaamonde 2015b, Vaamonde 2017a, Vaamonde 2018 (about <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> and partly with a focus on the
                            Spanish subcorpus), plus some presentations.</note> Then, these
                        publications were written at different points in time so it is hard to know
                        which ones are in line with the current state of the text collection as it
                        is presented online. Also, not all of the publications are Open Access and
                        directly available.<note xml:id="ftn27" n="27">In this case,
                            of the ones concerned with the description of <emph>P. S.

                            online, one is not.</note> In the opinion of this reviewer the
                        publications are an important form of scholarly output, but they cannot
                        replace background and context information published directly with the
                        digital text collection. If an external publication is used to document
                        central aspects of the digital resource and can be considered up-to-date,
                        this should be indicated on the website. This is done, for example, for the
                        guidelines describing the data model, the editorial and the annotation
                        procedures, which are all linked to from the homepage, but unfortunately not
                        for the criteria of selection and composition of the corpus.</p>

                    <p>Following the latest publication about the project (Vaamonde
                        2018), it seems that the primary motivation for the creation of the text
                        collection was the scarcity of sources of documenting spoken language for
                        historical linguistics. Archives of courts were chosen as an excellent
                        opportunity to get access to private correspondence, characterized by an
                        immediate, communicative style and not so much influenced by traditional
                        rhetoric. An overview of the consulted archives in Spain shows that most of
                        the letters could be localized in the National Historical Archive. Vaamonde
                        observes that the localization of letters in the archives is a procedure
                        strongly influenced by chance, as systematic catalogues or even databases
                        are rare. In some cases, the process was initiated with random samples.
                        Regarding the chronological distribution of the letters, the author notes
                        that it was hardest to get letters for the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century
                        (see Fig. 4 for an overview). Comparing these numbers with the search
                        results above, approximately 70 % of the located letters have been edited in
                            <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>.</p>

                        and partly in Portuguese. The data in <emph>P. S. Post
                            Scriptum</emph> is modelled in XML-TEI and in the first of the two
                        manuals, the entire TEI model is documented, including the TEI header,
                        transcription and editing conventions, changes to the TEI needed for the
                        linguistic annotation, the relationship of the project’s TEI model to
                        TEI-P5, and the separate TEI model for a bibliographic database containing
                        information about the participants of the letters. In the second manual, it
                        is explained how the texts have been treated further as a preparation for
                        linguistic annotation (e.g. modernization and sentence splitting) and how
                        they have been annotated morpho-syntactically. The transcription and editing
                        conventions as well as the linguistic annotations will be reviewed in the
                        corresponding sections on <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> as a
                        scholarly digital edition and as a linguistic corpus below. Here, the
                        general data model is discussed.</p>
                    <p>The data model of <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> –
                        at least the project internal model – is not a straightforward and plain TEI
                        model for several reasons. As Vaamonde explains, when the project started in
                        2012, the TEI had not decided to include specific elements for the encoding
                        of correspondence yet.<note xml:id="ftn31" n="31">This was
                            finally achieved in 2015 with the TEI-P5 release 2.8.0. Cf. Stadler et
                            al. 2016-2017.</note> It was therefore decided to follow the model of
                        another project concerned with the edition of letters, the <emph>Digital Archive of Letters by Flemish Authors and Composers from the
                            19th &amp; 20th century</emph> (DALF)<note xml:id="ftn32" n="32">See <ptr target="http://ctb.kantl.be/project/dalf/"/>. Accessed
                            June 1, 2018.</note>. Because the schema used in the DALF project was
                        based on TEI-P4, <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> inherited an
                        already outdated version of the standard. In a way, this is an ironic twist:
                        the intention was to take up the ongoing development of a dedicated module
                        for the encoding of correspondence and the project ended up with an older
                        version of the chosen XML standard. A good way out of this dilemma was
                        found, though: the decision to offer a TEI-P5 version as an export format
                        and to use the model adopted from DALF as an internal one. The version of
                        the data model conforming to TEI-P5 was influenced by the schema of the
                        CHARTA (<emph>Corpus Hispánico y Americano en la Red: Textos
                            Antiguos</emph>) network.<note xml:id="ftn33" n="33">Cf.
                            Vaamonde 2017c: 5f. The website of the CHARTA network is available at

                        It is to be valued positively that the <emph>P. S.
                            Post Scriptum</emph> project looked for models elsewhere in order to learn
                        from the experiences made in other projects, but especially in the case of
                        the DALF’s TEI-P4 model, the question arises why its innovations in terms of
                        correspondence description were not integrated directly into an own TEI-P5
                        model.</p>
                    <p>The elements specific for the encoding of correspondence were
                        not the only necessary customization of the schema. To add linguistic
                        annotations to the texts, the tool TEITOK (<emph>A Tokenized TEI
                            environment</emph>) was used, a web-based platform developed by Maarten
                        Janssen in which both rich textual markup and linguistic annotations can be
                        used in combination in single TEI files.<note xml:id="ftn34" n="34">See <ptr target="http://www.teitok.org/"/>.
                            Accessed June 1, 2018.</note> The TEI format used by TEITOK includes
                        custom elements for the tokenization and annotation of the text. A third
                        component of the family of data models in <emph>P. S.
                            Post Scriptum</emph> is a TEI-P4 model inherited from the CARDS project and
                        used for biographical information about the letters’ authors and
                            addressees.<note xml:id="ftn35" n="35">Cf. Vaamonde 2017c:

                    <p>On the website, each letter can be downloaded in the “Pure TEI
                        P5 XML” export format and in the “TEITOK XML” version based on the internal
                        TEI-P4 schema. In the P5 version, no schema is declared explicitly, so
                        supposedly the encoding follows the TEI_all schema. In the TEITOK version,
                        the internal DTD is linked. No schema file is offered directly on the
                        website and as the XML of the biographic database is not accessible, its
                        schema cannot be reviewed either.</p>
                    <p>All in all, the combination of different schemas and
                        customizations is a bit confusing for someone not familiar with the project.
                        No explanations are given directly on the website. However, the detailed
                        manual helps the user to follow the history of the project and the
                        complexities of the data model are layed out transparently in these
                        guidelines. Access to all the schema files would have been good to
                        facilitate a formal overview of the structure of the data and especially for
                        reuse scenarios to make consistency checks and schema adaptations
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>However, apart from how the information on the data model is
                        presented, the will to follow best practices developed in similar projects,
                        the orientation towards standards like the TEI, the thorough documentation
                        of the data model and the possibility to view the XML of the letters on the
                        website are all highly commendable.</p>

                        description as part of a change element. One would not expect translations
                        there, but it might also have been difficult to add the translations in
                        situ: the setting description could have been doubled, for example, but the

                    <p>Apparently, the “catRef” elements in the text classification
                        point to the type of category declared in the taxonomy, where the category
                        value is given in the description of the type of category. This seems a bit
                        odd, because a category with the same XML-ID can then have a different
                        category description or value in another letter file (for example, if the
                        type is not “pedición”, but a different pragmatic category. Also, it would
                        be good to have insight into the entire taxonomy.</p>
                    <p>It can furthermore be noticed that some fields are empty (in
                        this example, /location/geo for the destination as well as the category
                        description for “linguisticSource”). It is not clear how many of the
                        metadata fields are empty in the overall collection. In order to know
                        whether empty fields are due to work-in-progress or because a value is not
                        mandatory, the manual has to be consulted as there is no formal schema for
                        the TEI-P5 files available. On the website, no report is given on the state
                        of the XML files.</p>
                    <p>Besides the metadata for the letters, biographic metadata is
                        collected in the separate demographic database. In the edition manual, it is
                        described in detail how the data about correspondence participants is
                        modelled (for example, the role, sex, and age of a person are given, person
                        names, and a description of the events related to a person). In the letters,
                        there are pointers from the senders and addressees to the external
                        biographic data, but this data is not available for insight or download.</p>
                    <p>The metadata in <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> is
                        rich and conforms to the standards set by the TEI. Points of criticism which
                        can be raised are the missing access to some external metadata (the
                        biographic database and the complete taxonomy) and a report on the
                        completeness of the data.</p>

                    <p>Access to the letters and additional data related to the
                        correspondence is offered in a number of ways on the <emph>P. S.
                            Post Scriptum</emph> website. The biographical data, for example, can be
                        assessed via the “Participants” entry in the main menu. It is organized in
                        tabular format with one row per person (see Fig. 5). Overall, there are
                        5,071 rows which can be clicked through in steps of 100 entries. A
                        possibility to sort the data would have been nice, for example by a selected
                        column. As it is, it is not clear if the data is ordered at all and on what
                        principle. By clicking on one of the names, a detailed view of the entry is
                        shown. The only additional information in the detailed view is a link to the
                        letters written by the person, so the biographic data is a possible starting
                        point to get to the letters.</p>

                    <p>Besides these two possibilities to browse the text collection,
                        the main points of access are the search functions. There are two different
                        searches: the “Corpus Search” (simply named “Search” in the menu) and
                        “Syntactic Trees” (called “Tree Search” in the menu). The corpus search is
                        divided into the sections “Text Search”, “Document Search”, and “Discourse
                        Search”. The tree search is also divided into sections two of which are
                        specific for syntactic searches (both the “XPath Search” and the “Predefined
                        Queries” allow to search for specific syntactic units, e.g. subordinate
                        clauses or clitics) while the third one is a general “Document Search”. The
                        searches specific for the edited text and the syntactic annotation will be
                        discussed below in the section on <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>
                        as a scholarly digital edition and as a linguistic corpus, respectively. The
                        document search is identical in the two search interfaces and is shown in
                        Fig. 7.</p>
                    
                    <p>The document search allows to look for letters by language,
                        archive, year (or a range of years), letter code, origin, destination, or by
                        a list of thematic keywords (e.g. “Agriculture”, “Masonry”, “Church”). Only
                        one of the keywords can be chosen. Documents can also be searched for with
                        the names of the author or addressee and the social status and gender of the
                        author. A help section with further information about the search options is
                        available. The search is well-documented and easy to use. When the document
                        search is performed, the results are displayed in tabular format. The query
                        is automatically transformed into a <emph>Corpus Qu</emph><emph>ery Processor</emph> (CQP) string which is shown together
                        with the search results. The following string, for example, represents a
                        search for letters in Portuguese written by female authors up to the year
                        1600, yielding 55 results:</p>
                    <seg type="code" lang="formatted_text">&lt;text&gt; [] :: match.text_lang = "PT" &amp; int(match.text_year) &lt;=
                        1600 &amp; match.text_gender = "f"</seg>
                    <p>Beyond the powerful search functions, more browsing options
                        could have been offered. The only ways to browse the collection are the
                        biographic database and the geographic map, but this archive of letters
                        would have had much more to offer. Full indexes of the letters, for example
                        by identifier, year, place, etc., could have been implemented without much
                        additional effort. The search is especially helpful for someone who already
                        knows what she or he is looking for, but for a user interested in the
                        collection as a whole more browsing options would have been helpful to get
                        an overview of what is there. Examples of scholarly digital editions of
                        letters consistently offering both ways of access are <emph>Letters of 1916</emph><note xml:id="ftn36" n="36">See <ptr target="http://letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie/"/>. Accessed June

                    <p>With this general rights declaration it is not clear if the

                        in the project. One would expect the original, historical content of the
                        letters not to be subjected to copyright. With these contradictory
                        statements other researchers are left in uncertainty: Can they download and
                        use all the data in external tools without asking for permission? Is a
                        publication of the plain text files elsewhere not allowed or does this just
                        apply to the TEI files? A more detailed licensing in the TEI files and on
                        the website would help to clarify which types of reuse are in principle
                        allowed and for which cases a special permission is needed.</p>
                    <p>Finally, in terms of accessibility and usability of the text

                            interesting as a source for linguistic data, but also as a source for
                            historical data, and even as objects representing fragments of a practice,
                            produced manually by hundreds of persons who lived at a certain time in the
                            Early Modern Age and who put their daily preoccupations on paper. We are
                            definitely faced with a kind of documentation that can and must be
                            approached from three different perspectives: as an artefact, understood as
                            a physical object; as a text, understood as linguistic content; and as a
                            context, understood as the entirety of historical circumstances associated
                            with the text and the artifact. [...] our work as editors must be a
                            meticulous work striving to preserve every detail of the manuscript.”</p><ref>Vaamonde 2018: 148.<note xml:id="ftn45" n="45">Translated from

                    <p>Another level of the text that is edited are the discursive

                        sentences are classified as either harangue, peroration, or narration, for
                        example the peroration “Que o mesmo Senhor lha conserve [...]” (That the

                    <p>Each letter is presented on an individual page (see Fig. 8 for
                        an example). The metadata is presented at the top of the page, starting with
                        the autor, addressee, and letter summary. The metadata area can be expanded
                        for more detailed information and switched to English if translations are
                        available. The text of the letter is given on the left side with the
                        corresponding facsimile(s) to the right. The default text view is the
                        diplomatic transcription, but there are several alternatives that can be
                        chosen in the corresponding “View option” bar above the letter text:
                        “Edition”, “Variant form”, and “Standardization”. In the edition view,
                        abbreviations are expanded. The variant forms view shows the edited text
                        where deletions, for example, are excluded, but historical variants (e.g.
                        “cousa” for “coisa”) are kept. In the standardized view, the edited text is
                        given in a modernized form. Especially the last view is very helpful for a
                        user interested in the content of the letters without being familiar with
                        the historical conventions of writing and historical orthography. This is
                        also the text version that forms the basis for the linguistic annotation and
                        is essential for that task, because a modernized, established text version
                        without variants is usually expected by automatic taggers. The standardized
                        forms of single words are also shown in small boxes as a mouse-over
                        effect.</p>
                    <figure><head>Fig. 9: Sentence view of the letter PSCR0669.

                    <p>Besides the different text views, there are additional display
                        options grouped into the bars “Show” and “Tags”. With the options in the
                        “Show” bar, abbreviations, variants, and standardized forms can be
                        highlighted, the letter text can be displayed with original line breaks, and
                        the facsimiles can be switched on and off. In the “Tags” bar, the different
                        options serve to activate a tokenized version of the letter, to display the
                        part of speech and lemma of each word as well as additional notes on special
                        linguistic characteristics, for example words with clitic doubling in
                        Portuguese, complex syllables, diphthongs or hiatuses. At the bottom of the
                        page, there is a small legend indicating the colors used to display
                        editorial changes to the text. A “Sentence view” is also offered. In this
                        view, the text is split into sentences and displayed as one sentence per
                        line (see Fig. 9).</p>
                    
                    <p>There are two download options at the bottom of each letter
                        page, one for the download of the XML file, either in the TEI-P5 or in the
                        TEITOK version, the other for the download of the current view in a plain
                        text format.</p>
                    <p>Browsing through various letters, it becomes apparent that not
                        all of them have the same options. Some letter texts are not accompanied by
                        a facsimile (e.g. PSCR5513), some don’t have the detailed POS, lemma,
                        linguistic notes and sentence view options (e.g. PSCR5285), or the variant
                        and standardization views (both PSCR5513 and PSCR5285, for example). As for
                        other aspects mentioned before, it would have been good to have an overview
                        of the editing status of the letters in the whole collection. Another way to
                        make the state of progress more transparent would have been to include
                        search options allowing to look for finalized letters.</p>
                    <p>Although most of the functions are self-evident, a help text
                        explaining the meaning of the different text views, for example, would have
                        been helpful. If the view options are not documented exhaustively on the
                        website, a user might miss them if she or he by accident only views letters
                        where a few of them are available. It was not clear to the reviewer how to
                        find a letter where all options are available, if not by chance.</p>
                    <p>Of all the information encoded in the TEI files, the
                        discursive parts of the letters seem to be the only aspect that is not
                        presented. Apart from that, all the different levels of encoding can be
                        assessed via the web interface in a user-friendly manner. In addition, the
                        “Text Search” supports looking for words on the different levels of
                        transcription (provisional transcription, expanded abbreviations, and
                        standardization). Even if the parts of discourse are not taken up into the
                        HTML view, they can still be searched for with the “Discourse Search” which
                        allows to look for letters containing different types of sentences (opener,
                        closer, harangue, peroration, narration, etc.) and for letter types
                        (friendship, love, family, private business and anonymous letters).<note xml:id="ftn46" n="46">See <ptr target="https://web.archive.org/web/20180607152620/http:/ps.clul.ul.pt/index.php?action=cqp&amp;act=advanced"/>.</note></p>

                        annotation was then done with the package <emph>FreeLing</emph>

                        reports that it was a challenge to work with a range of tools providing
                        different output formats that could not be easily combined, especially the
                        information encoded in TEI with the different tagger outputs, leading to
                        different versions of the corpus that cannot be exploited altogether.<note xml:id="ftn49" n="49">Cf. Vaamonde 2018: 153.</note> This
                        is a common problem in projects working at the junction of different
                        disciplines in digital humanities.<note xml:id="ftn50" n="50">Similar experiences have been made in the project <emph>Computational Literary Genre Stylistics</emph> (CLiGS) that the
                            reviewer is part of. In CLiGS, it was decided to keep two versions of
                            the corpora of literary texts: a master version with structural and
                            inline TEI encoding and a linguistically annotated version where
                            FreeLing output in XML format is incorporated into a basic TEI
                            structure. Cf. Schöch et al. (forthcoming) and <ptr target="https://github.com/cligs/textbox"/>. Accessed June 1,
                            2018.</note> In <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>, the solution
                        was to centralize the linguistic treatment of the corpus in the tool TEITOK
                        which allows to store and treat both rich textual markup and linguistic
                        annotations in the same XML format.<note xml:id="ftn51" n="51">See Janssen 2016.</note> The tokenization, orthographic normalization,
                        lemmatization, and morphosyntactic annotation were all realized in TEITOK
                        after the import of the digitally edited TEI. The result is a format similar
                        to TEI, but with some custom elements and attributes as in the following
                        example from the letter PS7004:</p>

                    &lt;/s&gt;<lb/></seg>
                    <p>The original form of each token is kept as the content of the
                        “tok” element. In the “nform” attribute, a normalized version of the token
                        is given. The other attributes serve to hold the lemma, dialectal variants,
                        and so on.<note xml:id="ftn52" n="52">See Vaamonde and Magro
                            2018 for details about the meaning of the various attributes used in the
                            linguistic annotation.</note> So the basic unit chosen for the XML
                        version of a letter combining digital edition and corpus is the token or
                        word to which linguistic information is directly added. But the model is
                        also able to keep specific markup from the historical-philological edition.
                        If there is any markup inside a token such as a line break, for example, it
                        is kept. In the case of a span of underlined words, the element to encode
                        the highlighting surrounds several token elements.</p>
                    <p>From the point of view of this reviewer, it is not just a
                        technical question whether different layers of annotation are kept inside a
                        single file or modelled as stand-off markup. Of course a stand-off setup is
                        more difficult to process because units like sentences or words have to be
                        realigned when several layers of annotation are analyzed or presented
                        together. But to find a way to directly integrate both editorial markup and
                        linguistic annotations also contributes to build a rich resource which can be
                        archived in its integrity. In this scenario, the linguistic annotations
                        become part of the edition and are not just another layer which can be added
                        repeatedly in an ad-hoc way, especially if their quality is checked
                        manually. This is not to say that there aren’t any arguments for stand-off
                        markup, but that the editorial decision on the way to model annotations
                        contributes to define the type of resource that is created, in this case a
                        critically edited linguistic corpus.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the tokenization and lemmatization, also

                        comprehensive documentation of the editorial tasks involved in the
                        preparation of the texts for the linguistic annotations, the annotations
                        themselves, and the necessary follow-up works. On the project‘s homepage, it
                        is stated that about 25% of each balanced corpus (a corpus of one letter per
                        author in Portuguese and Spanish, respectively) has been annotated
                        syntactically. For the morphosyntactic annotation, it is not clear to what
                        extent it has been completed. The results of the morphosyntactic annotation
                        are directly incorporated into the XML encoding, as can be seen in the above
                        example, whereas the output formats of the syntactic annotation procedure
                        are in principle text-based. They were converted to the XML-based format
                        PSDX (an XML variant of the Penn Treebank format) and then aligned with the
                        main edition file containing the philological and linguistic information by
                        sentence and token, meaning that the syntactic annotation is kept
                        separately, but correlated.<note xml:id="ftn57" n="57">Ibd.:

                    <p>If a syntactic annotation is available for a letter, a

                        this view, the text is displayed in sentence rows. At the bottom, the link
                        “More files” leads to a list of letter IDs, supposedly all the letters with
                        syntactic annotation. Via the link “Search in this file”, a “Tree Search”
                        can be performed which is limited to the individual file. From the syntactic
                        trees view, the letter can be downloaded in either the Penn Treebank PSD or
                        in the PSDX format. This download option is not available from the main
                        letter page, so some clicks through the subpages are needed to get to

                    <p>Very much effort has been put into making the linguistic
                        annotations searchable. One way is to use the “Text Search” which is part of
                        the general “Corpus Search”. Fig. 12 shows an example of a search for words
                        in the standardized form containing the triphthong “uou”. Per default, the
                        results are displayed as <emph>Keyword in Context</emph> (KWIC) as
                        in Fig. 13. The search options are manifold: not only can the different
                        transcription layers of the edition be searched but also word classes,
                        lemmas, POS tags, and linguistic notes. Search queries can also directly be
                        formulated in the corpus query language CQP.</p>
                    
                    <p>The results page offers further options to display the
                        findings: by clicking on “context”, it is possible to jump to the text of
                        the whole letter and see the search term highlighted in it. Also, the
                        different textual views can be activated for the search results. A “Direct
                        query URL” is given and can be used to cite the search and its results (at
                        this point the technical character of the URL is understandable because it
                        is meant to reflect complex search queries).</p>

                    <p>Even more, the results of a query can be used to look for
                        collocations and display frequency tables and visualizations by using the
                        “Frequency Options” below the search results (see Fig. 14 for a bar chart
                        showing the frequency of the triphthong “uou” by lemma).<note xml:id="ftn58" n="58">In this case, the lemmas for the
                            words “autuou”, “efetuou”, and “jejuou” were not recognized. “Continuou”
                            occurred five times in the search results, but was only lemmatized in
                            three cases. The results in this example might have been influenced by
                            files where the annotation has not been finished.</note> The frequency
                        calculations are a useful feature and the various visualization options of
                        their results are a convenient extra, but as for the different
                        visualizations of syntactic trees the different types of charts are not
                        essential for their information value, because they all present the same
                        counts. A welcome feature is the possibility to download all the search
                        results in text-based formats for future use.</p>

                    <p>For the syntactic annotations, there is a dedicated search
                        (“Tree Search”, see Fig. 15), with an XPath Search field and a number of
                        predefined queries. It is possible to choose between several options for the
                        display of the results (brackets, table graph, vertical graph, etc.). The
                        XPath search operates on the PSDX format containing the syntactic
                        annotations in XML. The predefined queries help to get started with the
                        XPath expressions which can be quite complex depending on the structure of
                        interest. A search for adverbial clauses, for example, is formulated as
                        //eTree[@Label="CP-ADV"], a search for indirect questions as
                        //eTree[contains(@Label, "IP") and ./eTree[@Label="CP-QUE"]], and for
                        postverbal subjects //*[eTree[contains(@Label,
                        "NP-SBJ")]/preceding-sibling::eTree[contains(@Label, "VB")]]. The results
                        are displayed per sentence. A search for postverbal subjects, for example,
                        yields 1,700 results. A tree view of one of the resulting sentences (“corre
                        a fama” – “runs the rumour”) is given in Fig. 16.</p>
                    
                    <p>Both for the general corpus search and for the syntactic
                        search, basic help texts are offered. Not every search option is explained
                        but the information that is given helps the user to find his or her way
                        through the search forms when using the various access points that are

                        corpus.</p>
                    <p>Altogether, a remarkable range and amount of linguistic
                        information has been added to the edited texts of the letters and it has
                        been integrated convincingly into the entire text collection. The many
                        possibilities to search for specific linguistic annotations, to view them in
                        the context of the transcribed documents and to download almost all of the
                        generated information (the linguistic data itself, the search results, and
                        visualizations of corpus distributions as well as of linguistic details such
                        as single clauses) must be a great asset for a historical corpus linguist.
                        While the rich user interface supports qualitative as well as quantitative
                        work, the option to download all data in text- as well as XML-based formats
                        is ideal for researchers who would like to integrate the data into their own

                <p>Officially, <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> is a
                    finished project. On the website, no comments on the future of the data or the
                    maintenance of the project website itself are found. But even though the funding
                    period ended in 2017, the user manual on the linguistic annotations was still
                    updated in March 2018 and this reviewer got an immediate answer and help from
                    the project coordinator when the website was slowing down during the reviewing
                    process. As the project was based at the Linguistics Centre of the University of
                    Lisbon and is also technically hosted there, the prospects are good that there
                    will be institutional support for this digital text collection also in the
                    future. The graphical user interface is generated with the tool TEITOK, a
                    platform that has already been in use for 14 research projects, so it can be
                    assumed that it will also be maintained further on. Even if the website and user
                    interface should be shut down at some point, the underlying data is held in
                    standard formats and could be kept and used in other environments. Nothing is
                    said on the website about external repositories for the data. It would be an
                    option to additionally store the XML and text data in an infrastructure designed
                    for the long-term, for example at a CLARIN centre.<note xml:id="ftn59" n="59">See <ptr target="https://www.clarin.eu/content/repositories"/>. Accessed June 1,

                <p>In terms of documentation, it has already been said that many
                    publications have been produced in <emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph>
                    contributing to a whole range of disciplines. Not only has the project itself
                    been documented meticulously in the publications and manuals, but its results as
                    a digital scholarly edition and historical linguistic corpus have also already
                    been made fruitful in analytic research contributions by members of the project,
                    securing the transfer of knowledge from the project to the relevant
                    disciplines.</p>
                <p>An open question, which all project-based digital resources face,
                    is how to proceed with changes to the data. In <emph>P. S.
                        Post Scriptum</emph>, the levels of encoding and annotation are not the same
                    for all the data. This has probably various reasons: two different languages
                    that need to be dealt with, data coming from preceding projects, decisions to
                    change annotation procedures, the end of the funding period, and many more.
                    Although the ideal would be to have completely homogenous, completed data, it is
                    even more important to communicate the state of the data clearly to give the
                    users orientation. In addition, an explicit contact address, a contact form, or
                    a ticket system could enable users to report anything that they come across
                    while using the platform. This could even be left unmonitored but would make it
                    possible to collect feedback for those who want to reuse the data or in case
                    there would be a follow-up project.</p>
                <p>For the long run, a more explicit and detailed licensing of the
                    data is also important to ensure that other researchers take the opportunity to
                    work with the results of <emph>P. S. </emph><emph>Post Scriptum</emph>. As it is, the project‘s strategy to grant free access to
                    the data but to publish the TEI files under copyright can not be considered an
                    overall Open Access policy (see the <ref target="#p35">discussing of rights issues above</ref>).</p>

                <head>Conclusion</head>
                <p><emph>P. S. Post Scriptum</emph> can certainly be
                    classified both as a scholarly digital edition and a diachronic linguistic
                    corpus. It can be considered pioneer work in combining procedures from textual
                    criticism with the linguistic preparation of the corpus — on the levels of the
                    data model, the use of an integrated research environment, and the presentation
                    and possibilities of interaction with the results on the website.</p>
                <p>Valuable basic work has been done in collecting, transcribing, and
                    encoding the approximately 5,000 historical private letters kept in archives all
                    over the Iberian Peninsula and making them available to researchers and to the
                    public. The decision to make all basic data available for download is exemplary.
                    An open licence would have been desirable for data reuse, but still it is
                    very useful to have insight into the data.</p>
                <p>The project has followed community standards and advice from
                    similar editorial undertakings, thereby making its data reusable and prepared
                    for the future. The detailed documentation makes up for a partly complex
                    combination of data standards and tools, originating from the project’s history
                    and its double goal to edit the corpus critically and prepare it
                    linguistically.</p>
                <p>The site’s usability would have benefitted from more context
                    information directly presented on the website to guide a user not familiar with
                    the project and also to have the latest information about the selection, amount,
                    distribution, and state of the data in one place. It would have been good to
                    include filters for the availability of annotation layers into the search forms
                    (e.g. to only show letters with completed linguistic annotation). On the other
                    hand, some of the many visualization options for statistics and syntactic trees
                    could have been skipped. Still, the range of search options that have been
                    implemented for the graphical user interface is impressive. It could only have
                    been enhanced by more options to browse through the collection of letters.</p>
                <p>It is to be hoped that this carefully edited and comprehensively
                    prepared corpus of private correspondence will be maintained and used by many
                    linguists, historians, and digital humanists to come.</p>
