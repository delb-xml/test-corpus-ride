            <p>This review addresses the redesign of the William Blake Archive (WBA), which launched
               12 December 2016, updating our <ref
                  target="http://ride.i-d-e.de/issues/issue-5/the-william-blake-archive/">previous
                  review</ref> of the Archive, published in early 2017. Through this update,
               described as ‘a complete and transformative redesign,’ all of the content of the
               previous site has been retained, with improvements to the overall aesthetic appeal
               and functionality. These functionality updates principally consist of a modernized
               navigation system; a redesigned Object View page that organizes WBA’s scholarly tools
               within a matrix of panels; and a more comprehensive archival search engine. These new
               features provide users with enhanced opportunities for interacting with the objects
               contained in the archive. The notable shortcoming of this update is that the many of
               WBA’s formerly comprehensive help documentation and tutorial features have not been
               updated. Both new and veteran users would benefit from the reintroduction of clear,
               organized documentation to explain the Archive’s new features.</p>

            <p xml:id="p2">The notable shortcoming of this update is that the WBA’s formerly
               comprehensive help documentation and tutorial features were not fully updated at the
               time of the site’s relaunch. While some of the user interface improvements are
               intuitive enough to require no explanation, others are considerably more complex –
               such as the new Object View page and its dual viewing ‘modes.’ As this review goes to
               press, we are pleased to see some <ref
                  target="http://www.blakearchive.org/staticpage/archiveataglance?p=techsummary"
                  >additional technical documentation</ref> has been added to the site’s Technical
               Summary, including some discussion of the two viewing modes. We believe this
               information should be highlighted and made more accessible for users. Guidance for
               non-technical users is currently provided through the help (‘?’) icon, but its detail
               is limited. Both new and veteran users would benefit from the reintroduction of
               clear, non-technical documentation to explain the Archive’s features and new system
               of organization. Improvements in this area would enable WBA’s considerable aesthetic
               and functional updates to become fully accessible and useful to its audience as an
               improved Scholarly Digital Edition (SDE).</p>

            <p xml:id="p3">The Archive’s redesign team was headed by co-editor Joseph Viscomi.
               Ashley Reed served as the Consultant on Special Projects and former Project Manager,
               Joseph Fletcher as the Managing Editor, and Michael Fox as the Assistant Editor and
               system architect of the upgrade’s front and back end. For more information on the
               individuals and organizations involved in the upgrade, please see WBA’s <ref

                  update announcement</ref> from 12 December 2016.</p>
            <p xml:id="p4">The Editors began directing the process of architecting a new site in
               late 2013, and in early 2014 partnered with UNC’s Libraries and ITS Research
               Computing to re-conceptualize the public face of the Archive so that it would ‘again
               set the gold standard for digital humanities projects’ (WBA, <ref
                  target="http://www.blakearchive.org/staticpage/update?p=update-2016-12-16">12 Dec
                  2016</ref>). The new back end was built using the open source, object-relational
               database system, <ref
                  target="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509010458/https://www.postgresql.org/about/"
                  >PostgreSQL</ref>, in combination with the open source enterprise search platform,
               Solr. The new front end was created using the <ref
                  target="https://docs.angularjs.org/misc/faq">AngularJS framework</ref>, a
               structural framework meant to assist developers in building dynamic, single-page
               applications. In recent months, WBA published a more detailed summary on its new
               system architecture and basic front-end navigation in its <ref

            <head>Overview of changes to user experience</head>
            <p xml:id="p5">The updated WBA features a visually appealing, high-quality colour
               homepage, with a rotating series of images from Blake’s work displayed in a tiled
               form. One of the greatest improvements to the site is its static drop-down top menu
               (and anchored bottom screen menu), now accessible from the homepage and every other
               page within the site. The reading and gallery modes offer two different systems for
               interacting with the objects in the archive, enabling various scholarly tasks.</p>
            <p xml:id="p6">There is no longer a separate page for help documentation; instead,
               navigational instructions, searching instructions, or an explanation regarding the
               use of different viewing modes is available in the help (‘?’) icon depending upon
               which page-type the user is visiting. It was not clear to us immediately that the
               information contained in the help icon was dynamic, changing based on wherever one
               was on the site. Although this dynamic icon provides important information, we
               believe it would be useful to have all site documentation gathered in a single place
               as well, including both site-usage methods and terminology. A series of short video
               tutorials could also greatly enhance user accessibility and full utilization of the
               archive.</p>

                     <head type="legend">The new homepage.</head>
                  </figure> Aesthetically, the front-facing user interface has greatly improved. It
                  has a modern and responsive page layout, an attractive color scheme, and a dynamic
                  homepage which loads a freshly randomized gallery of artifact thumbnails with each
                  user visit.</p>
               <p xml:id="p8">Structurally, the AngularJS framework has been leveraged to improve
                  upon the Object View page. Each artifact’s scholarly tools and editorial
                  supplementation are now accessible within the Object View page, organized in a
                  matrix of panels. This change addresses our primary criticism of the original
                  site, which was programmed to open these features in new, individual browser
                  windows. Now, rather than having to navigate and arrange many additional windows
                  in order to view comprehensive information about an object, informed users are
                  able to quickly and easily navigate between panels and view all object-associated
                  information within a single page. This transformation allows the complexities of
                  Blake's works to be better viewed, explored, and compared.</p>

            <div xml:id="div4.2">
               <head>Navigation</head>
               <p xml:id="p9">Another major shortcoming of the former WBA site was its lack
                  consistent navigation features. With this upgrade, the problem has been addressed.
                  New to WBA are two banner menus, permanently anchored to the top and bottom of the
                  site at all times. The top menu helps users navigate archival content, while the
                  bottom links users to the WBA’s associated works, meta writings, and scholarly
                  material.</p>
               <p xml:id="p10">The top menu is now the user’s sole navigatory tool to explore WBA’s
                  archive of digital artifacts. It consists of the following: <list rend="bulleted">
                     <item>A search bar, which requires the user to enter a keyword in order to
                        initiate a search and be redirected to the the filter-reliant Search Results
                        page.</item>
                     <item>An expandable hamburger menu of five main tabs (illuminated books,
                        commercial book illustrations, separate prints and prints in series,
                        drawings and paintings, manuscripts and typographic works) that usefully
                        organize Blake’s works. Within each submenu are chronological indices of
                        Blake’s works, divided into the Editor’s medium-based categories. Clicking
                        on the title of a work will open its Work Information page, from which
                        individual copies/objects can be opened in the Object View page.</item>
                     <item>A toggle button between the letters ‘G’ and ‘R’ that allows the user to
                        alternate between two ‘modes’ for experiencing the Object View page –
                        Gallery mode and Reading mode.</item>
                     <item>A help icon, demarcated by a question mark (‘?’). When clicked, this icon
                        will open a panel which contains explanatory information about Gallery and
                        Reading mode, and additional information specific to the type of page the
                        user currently has loaded. This means the contents of the help icon panel
                        changes based on whether the user is on the homepage, the Object View page,
                        the Search Results page, etc.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p xml:id="p11">The bottom menu directs users to the Archive’s supplementary
                  scholarly material and information about the site, highlighting: <list
                     rend="bulleted">
                     <item>WBA’s official blog, which has also received a substantial UI
                        update</item>
                     <item>The ‘Blake / An Illustrated Quarterly’ archive</item>
                     <item>‘The Complete Poetry And Prose Of William Blake, David Erdman’: an
                        electronic version of Erdman’s revised 1998 scholarly edition of Blake’s
                        poetical works, and a feature of the original site which has been given new
                        prominence here</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p xml:id="p12">The bottom menu also sub-hierarchically links to the site’s other
                  features, such as its biographical information on Blake, the detailed and
                  important ‘About the Archive’ section, WBA’s recommended resources for further
                  research, and so on. All content of the original site appears to have been
                  preserved in these static pages, with the exception of the site’s Virtual Lightbox
                  applet, Help page, and now outdated java-based tutorial, the ‘Tour of the
                  Archive.’ At the time of update, there was no indication if or when the Virtual
                  Lightbox and/or its function as a digital workspace would be redeveloped and
                  reintroduced to the updated site. In September 2017, however WBA appended a note
                  to their Technical Summary section announcing that in the near future it will be
                  adding two substantive additions to the site: A revamped Lightbox application and
                  a new exhibition space for the publication of peer-reviewed exhibitions.
                  Meanwhile, the absence of a renewed Help page is more immediately concerning. The
                  help documentation provided by the help icon panel is considerably more limited
                  than its historical precedent. Hopefully this issue will be addressed in the near
                  future to help new and old users become acquainted with the new site’s design.</p>

               <head>Object View</head>
               <p xml:id="p13">Objects in the Archive now open in the central panel of the website’s
                  responsive page layout. As mentioned, there are two different ‘modes’ of view that
                  can be toggled between on the Object View page. These modes represent two
                  different remediations of the editorial features affixed to its archived objects.
                  Rather than isolating an object’s relevant editorial features into individual
                  pop-up windows, as was previously the case, the site’s new framework-based model
                  allows users to mix and match the information they want to see within a matrix of
                  panels and according to a ‘Gallery’ or ‘Reading’-based visual ‘mode.’</p>
               <p xml:id="p14">

                     <head type="legend">Gallery Mode.</head>
                  </figure> In Gallery mode, the digital facsimile of the selected object opens in
                  the central panel. Located at the left and right edges of the central panel are
                  clickable thumbnails of the previous and subsequent objects in the copy – allowing
                  users to progress forwards and backwards through the work. Directly beneath the
                  facsimile is a line of copyright information, and a toolbar that allows users to
                  visually manipulate the image for closer examination – offering them the option
                  to: rotate, magnify, restore to true size, enlarge in a new window, and open the
                  object’s diplomatic transcription at right.</p>
               <p xml:id="p15">Below the central panel is a container that allows the user to tab
                  between the following panels: <list rend="bulleted">
                     <item>Objects in Copy – this panel presents thumbnails of all the objects that
                        exist in the open copy of the work. These objects will open in the central
                        panel when clicked.</item>
                     <item>Object from the Same Matrix – if multiple copies of an object exist, this
                        panel is present and showcases the thumbnails of all its existing copies
                        (openable in the central panel when clicked). These thumbnails can also be
                        selected via a corner checkbox for side-by-side comparison in the central
                        panel – a remediation of the former WBA’s important ‘Compare’
                        feature.</item>
                     <item>Copy Information – this panel presents the available bibliographic
                        information of the copy to which the object belongs.</item>
                     <item>Electronic Edition Information – this panel presents the copy’s full
                        digitization record.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p xml:id="p16">The rest of WBA’s scholarly features are appended to the left of the
                  page within a small yellow ‘i’ tab (presumably for ‘Information’). When clicked
                  upon, this tab expands a panel on the left containing the object’s Illustration
                  Description, Editor’s Notes, and (in its second placement on this page) the
                  Diplomatic Transcription. As the name suggests, by design Gallery Mode treats the
                  digital photo-facsimiles as central, and makes readily available the tools that
                  assist with viewing (rotate, magnify, view full size) and descriptions relevant
                  (such as the “illustration description) and editor’s note on the original object
                  itself. The Gallery Mode allows for the diplomatic transcription to be viewed
                  either to the right (when the bottom diplomatic display button is displayed) and
                  to the left (when the left-hand button is clicked). It is not clear why this
                  redundancy has been introduced.</p>

                     <head type="legend">Reading Mode.</head>
                  </figure> In Reading mode, objects open alongside their diplomatic transcription
                  in a horizontally-scrollable central panel which contains the fully-loaded work.
                  Scrolling left to right lets users pass through all objects of their selected copy
                  in sequential order (backwards or forwards) without clicking on a new object to
                  open (as happens in Gallery Mode). This allows for continuous reading and a truer
                  experience of engaging with the original material. The centrality of the
                  diplomatic transcription (where relevant) also emphasizes that this mode has been
                  designed for reading. </p>
               <p xml:id="p18">Reading mode also has a line of buttons along the bottom of the
                  central panel that gives users the option to replace the default Diplomatic
                  Transcription with the following features: <list rend="bulleted">
                     <item>Illustration Description</item>
                     <item>Editors’ Notes</item>
                     <item>Images Only</item>
                     <item>Compare with another Copy. Here, the Compare feature acts by presenting
                        all selected copies of each object uncollated and in chronological
                        order.</item>
                  </list> There is also a button to view the current object at its true size, and a
                  localized magnifying glass feature that can be directed using the mouse. These
                  options reintroduce some elements that are accessible in Gallery mode.</p>
               <p xml:id="p19">Reading mode excludes some of the object-based critical tools of
                  Gallery mode: most noticeably the Copy Information and Electronic Edition
                  Information, as well as the extent of its image manipulation tools. However, in
                  the case of Blake’s illuminated books, it allows users to read through the entire
                  copy of a work in a closer format to how it was meant to be consumed. The
                  horizontal, scrollable format makes an optical ‘reading’ of Blake a much more
                  feasible and authentic experience than the formerly object-isolating iteration of
                  the Archive allowed.</p>
               <p xml:id="p20">WBA presents these two modes without suggestion as to how either
                  might be used for distinctive activities, but according to our assessment: <list
                     rend="bulleted">
                     <item>Gallery mode appears to be intended for material scholars who want to
                        engage with Blake on an artifact-by-artifact level, and who want to be able
                        to examine his creative objects with all the scholarly tools and material
                        associated them.</item>
                  </list> and <list rend="bulleted">

                        work as a whole, and for consuming Blake’s works as literature and/or in
                        their entirety.</item>

                  </figure> The WBA’s previously separate text and image search functions are now
                  combined into a single engine that is accessible from site’s top-anchored search
                  bar. The search results now return objects that contain the search query in any of
                  their attached editorial information fields. These results are then presented in
                  separate sections according to the type of field the keywords were found in (e.g.
                  Title, Transcription, Illustration Description, etc.). As this review goes to
                  print, a button labeled ‘IT’ for ‘Image Tags’ has also been added to the right of
                  the search bar. When clicked, the IT button opens a panel featuring a list of all
                  searchable image keywords for user reference. After submitting one or more
                  keywords in the search bar, users are given the option to craft a more advanced
                  search query, by being provided with a three filter system to sift through their
                  initial search results. The filters work as follows: <list rend="bulleted">
                     <item>Date – Restricts the results by composition and/or printing date, or
                        range of dates.</item>
                     <item>Type – Limits the search for the user’s keywords to one or more of the
                        following information fields: Title, Transcription, Image Tag, Editors’
                        Note, Illustration Description, Copy Information, and Work
                        Information.</item>
                     <item>Medium – Limits the search results to one or more of the medium-based
                        categories of Blake’s works that appear in the upper menu: Illuminated
                        Books, Commercial Book Illustrations, Separate Prints, Drawings and
                        Paintings, Manuscripts and Typographic Editions.</item>
                  </list> Selecting an object from the search results will then open a preview
                  panel, which contains the object’s digital facsimile on the left, and the
                  information field in which the keyword was found on the right (with the search
                  keyword(s) specially highlighted). In this preview panel, users can move between
                  matching objects from multiple copies, and switch copies as desired. By clicking
                  directly on the previewed text or facsimile thumbnail, user’s can navigate to
                  either the Work or Object View page.</p>

               <head>Help documentation and tutorials</head>
               <p xml:id="p22">The most prominent shortcoming of the new site is its lack of a
                  centralized location for help documentation and best practices. The Help page and
                  Tour of the Archive tutorial from the site’s previous iteration were both removed,
                  rather than updated. All that exists in terms of explicit help documentation now
                  is an anchored help icon with dynamic contents. When clicked, this help icon
                  expands an overlay panel onto the page with a short explanation of the Mode toggle
                  and a short explanation of how to use whichever page the user is currently using.
                  Specifically, these contents change according to three different page types – the
                  Homepage, Object View, Search Results, Work Information, and the Archive’s static
                  pages (e.g. ‘About of the Archive’, ‘About Blake’, etc.). Unfortunately, the icon
                  gives no written or visual indication to the user that its contents change based
                  on the page-type, which can preclude users from bothering to open the function
                  again when they get lost or confused.</p>
               <p xml:id="p23">While intuitive interface design has been for the most part
                  successfully employed in the site update, the lack of a new introduction to and
                  thorough explanation of WBA’s scholarly tools and their placement in its user
                  interface creates an unneeded barrier for both new and old users attempting to
                  find their bearings.</p>

               </figure> The site can now be used on mobile, albeit with certain limitations. On
               mobile, Gallery Mode is stripped of the visual manipulation toolbar and the
               information tab, although the four tabs below the central panel (Objects in Copy,
               Objects from the Same Matrix, Copy Information, and Electronic Information) are still
               present. The ‘Compare’ feature still functions, but its usefulness is limited due to
               the fact that one must swipe between the ‘compared’ objects in the central panel, and
               cannot view them side-by-side simultaneously. Reading mode is stripped of all its
               supplementary button options and consists solely of each object paired with its
               Diplomatic Transcription and presented in a vertical scrolling format, not
               horizontal, regardless of one’s phone-orientation. There are also several formatting
               bugs and loading issues that crop up from time to time based on one’s page location,
               browser, or mobile device, so optimization still has a way to go in this area.</p>

            <head>Technical Accessibility</head>
            <p xml:id="p25">While not readily apparent upon its initial upgrade, WBA has revealed
               improved technical accessibility several months into its new iteration. XML files are
               now directly attached to each object for view under its Electronic Edition
               Information, and an <ref
                  target="http://www.blakearchive.org/staticpage/archiveataglance?p=api">API
                  tab</ref> has been added to the About the Archive section for users who wish to
               mine WBA’s data. Finally, in its Technical Summary, WBA now links to the open source
               repositories of its <ref target="https://github.com/blakearchive/">github
                  organization, blakearchive</ref>. This improved access to basic site data is a
               boon both to web developers and data analysts in the digital humanities field.</p>

            <head>Questions of Legacy</head>
            <p xml:id="p26">This upgrade was not formerly announced to the public until the new site
               was launched on December 12, 2016, entirely replacing the previous iteration of the
               site. While some of the Archive’s static pages have been preserved and are accessible
               via entries on <ref target="https://web.archive.org/">Internet Archive's Wayback
                  Machine</ref> (some of which are linked in our review of the old site) WBA has not
               made it clear if a legacy version of the website pre-upgrade still exists, and/or if
               it will ever again be accessible by public users. The removal of the old site raises
               certain questions about the conservation of legacy digital projects: might it have
               been beneficial for the longest running iteration of one of digital humanities’
               longest running SDEs to still be accessible, even if it is no longer the most up to
               date iteration of the project? While outdated in terms of modern website standards,
               WBA’s former incarnation was a powerful and fascinating demonstration of early SDE
               development. Arguably, the decision to take down one of the earliest and most
               influential work of digital humanities’ scholarship represents a loss. An appending
               question of legacy relates to the fact that due to its current programming and
               design, WBA’s current incarnation prevents its web pages from being easily archived
               by the public using Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. With this development, how
               difficult will it be for most public observers to track changes and progress in WBA
               and similar digital humanities projects? And is this something the field should be
               concerned about?</p>

            <head>Conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="p27">This upgrade to the WBA preserves the project’s extensive and rigorous
               collection of scholarly-mediated objects, while radically reinventing its front-end
               into a framework-based structure. This structure remediates scholarly features
               previously openable in pop-up windows into a collection of mix-and-match panels or
               tabs—better presenting WBA’s archived objects in tandem with their scholarly context.
               Many of the site’s new features, like horizontal scrolling and large image display,
               deliver appreciable improvements for the academic study of Blake as an artist and
               poet. However, the site requires renewed documentation to provide new and continuing
               users with clear instructions on how to use the site.</p>
            <p xml:id="p28">The upgrade has also improved WBA’s technical accessibility - improving
               access to object XML, introducing a site API for data mining, and making public its
               open-source github repositories. These additions provide digital humanities
               technologists with new ways to inspect and interact with the WBA project. The removal
               of the old site also raises important questions about the cultural legacy of digital
               humanities sites, and whether elements of the original interface should be preserved
               along with the project’s data.</p>
