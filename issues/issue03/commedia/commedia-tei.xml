            <p>The <emph>Commedia</emph> project aims to investigate the manuscript transmission of
               the poem, using Sanguineti's previous edition and checking the validity of his stemma
               with computer methods. Full transcriptions of the seven selected witnesses are
               provided alongside the corresponding facsimiles. The end results of the collation and
               phylogenetic analysis differ from Sanguineti's edition and reshape the stemma. No new
               critical text is provided. The edition is easy to navigate and high quality editorial
               materials are available. A metrical markup enriches the text and the integrated VBase
               tool allows the user to retrieve variants in different witnesses and parts of the
               poem.</p>

            <head>Editing the <emph>Commedia</emph>: a short history</head>
            <p xml:id="p1">2010 saw the publication of a digital edition of the
                  <emph>Commedia</emph> overseen by Prue Shaw. Written in the first quarter of the
               14th century, Dante’s masterpiece traces the poet’s journey through the topographies
               of the afterlife. The poem is divided into three <emph>cantiche</emph>
                  (<emph>Inferno</emph>, <emph>Purgatorio</emph>, <emph>Paradiso</emph>), each
               composed of 33 cantos, themselves written in hendecasyllabic tercets.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2">The <emph>Commedia</emph> has a long and controversial editorial history.
               This is hardly surprising given the work’s resonance throughout centuries and thus
               the number of witnesses of the poem, over 600 including complete manuscripts and
               early printed editions. Scholars have deployed a range of editorial strategies in an
               attempt to settle on a critical text of the <emph>Commedia</emph>. In this section, I
               will summarise these strategies in brief, focusing on those elements of each that
               remain relevant to the edition under review.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3">The length of the text and the number of witnesses has made it difficult
               to compare versions of the text in their entirety. At the end of the 19th century,
               Michele Barbi sought something of a compromise: he selected a series of lines – the
               so-called <emph>400 loci</emph> (Bartoli, D'Ancona, and Del Lungo 1891; Barbi 1891) –
               drawn from various points in the <emph>Commedia</emph>. Scholars were invited to
               check these lines in those manuscripts of the poem to which they each had access and
               to send a record of them to the Società Dantesca Italiana. Unfortunately, only a
               handful of these scholars replied and Barbi’s initiative turned over very little
               material.</p>
            <p xml:id="p4">Following the Vandelli (Vandelli 1921) and Casella (Casella 1923)
               editions, Giuseppe Petrocchi drafted a new <emph>Edizione Nazionale</emph> in 1965 on
               the occasion of the seventh centenary of Dante's birth (Petrocchi 1965). Petrocchi
               chose to limit his project to manuscripts that dated before 1355; the project’s
               theoretical underpinning was that witnesses drafted after that date were likely
               contaminated, largely because of the scribal and editorial endeavours of Giovanni
               Boccaccio, who copied out the entire <emph>Commedia</emph> at least three times,
               introducing variants from other copies. Petrocchi's critical text is an attempt to
               reconstruct the so-called <emph>antica vulgata</emph> in use during the three decades
               following Dante's death rather than an archetype; this last concept is hardly
               applicable to a text which was almost certainly released in sections.</p>
            <p xml:id="p5">Antonio Lanza's 1995 edition had a different aim: following Bedier's
               prescripts, the editor reproduced a <emph>bon manuscrit</emph> – copied in Florence
               in 1337 –, referring to early Florentine manuscripts in order to make amendments only
               where strictly necessary (Lanza 1995).</p>
            <p xml:id="p6">In 2001, Federico Sanguineti published a new edition using a small pool
               of witnesses: seven manuscripts known as ‘the Sanguineti seven’. His stemma consists
               of two branches: α and β; to simplify, manuscripts from Tuscany form the α branch,
               while those from Northern Italy form the β branch. As a general rule in textual and
               linguistic transmission, the peripheral geographical areas tend to be more
               conservative than the centre; Florence had early on become an active centre for
               reproductions of the <emph>Commedia</emph>, while northern manuscripts tended to be
               less innovative. Sanguineti decided to use the only second branch witness – ms.
               Urbinate Latino 366 of the Vatican Library (Urb), written in Emilia Romagna – as the
               base-text for his critical edition. It is worth clarifying that ms. Urbinate’s
               solitary position in the β branch is due to the limited overall number of witnesses
               Sanguineti chose to mobilise and to his choice to move ms. Rb (now disjointed in two
               voumes: <emph>Inferno</emph>, <emph>Purgatorio</emph> at the Biblioteca Riccardiana,
               while <emph>Paradiso</emph> at Biblioteca Nazionale Braidense) from the β to the α
               branch. Critics drawn to Sanguineti's edition have repeatedly expressed their concern
               regarding the scarcity of readings offered as a proof of validity of his stemmatic
               hypothesis and their distribution along small sections of the poem (e.g., Segre
               2002).</p>
            <p xml:id="p7">This last step in the editorial history of the <emph>Commedia</emph> is
               particularly relevant to the edition under review. Sanguineti was originally part of
               the <emph>Commedia project</emph>, whose goal was, in part, to test the validity of
               his stemma. At the time of the project’s inception, the scholars involved anticipated
               a positive result for Sanguineti. In Shaw's words, 'it seems important to emphasize
               that the conclusions we reached are not those we expected to reach when we started
               out on the digital <emph>Commedia project</emph> [...]. The result turned out to be
               more interesting and complex'.</p>

            <head>Introduction: Shaw's edition</head>
            <p xml:id="p8">The <emph>Commedia Project</emph> officially ran from 1998 to 2010, with
               funding from The British Academy, The Arts and Humanities Research Council, The
               Modern Humanities Research Association and the Rockefeller Foundation. The venture’s
               main actors were Prue Shaw (editor), Jennifer Marshall (research assistant) and Peter
               Robinson (responsible for the information technology side of the project). As
               mentioned in the foreword to the edition, the genesis of the project dates back to
               the early 1990s; the original idea spread between Europe and Australia, and the
               project was finally structured between 1998 and 2001, when Federico Sanguineti's
               edition appeared. In 2010, Shaw’s Digital Edition was released online and on DVD. The
               present review deals only with the online edition – however, there is no difference
               in content between the two versions.</p>
            <p xml:id="p9">Shaw's digital edition has much to recommend it: it provides critics with
               access to seven of the most important witnesses of the poem in both extremely
               accurate transcription and high-definition images; it questions the soundness of
               Sanguineti’s stemma by putting it to the test of phylogenetic analysis and
               de-stabilizes assumptions surrounding the validity of the position of ms. Rb – the
               basis of Sanguineti's critical text; it provides word collation and tools for
               investigating variants distribution across the witnesses. Finally, it presents high
               quality editorial materials on textual and technological aspects.</p>
            <p xml:id="p10">The decision to limit the scope of the project to the Sanguineti seven
               manuscripts alone has invited some criticism (Inglese 2012). However, the editors
               were interested in Sanguineti's hypothesis from the offset precisely because ‘such a
               small number of manuscripts would make a computer project a feasible possibility’
               (see below). The selection reflects a paradox well known to textual scholars dealing
               with large manuscript transmission and with long texts: though computers do indeed
               allow human beings to process great quantities of data quickly, preparing materials
               to be computer-readable might be time consuming to the degree of nullifying the
               advantages gleaned from the former. Every project must of necessity reach a
               compromise with its ambition (for a different strategy in applying digital
               technologies to the edition of the <emph>Commedia</emph>, see Renello 2013).</p>

               and abbreviations are expanded in italics. The only exceptions to the transciption’s
               fidelity lie in the manuscript’s punctuation, which is not recorded, and in the

               another major web resource for scholars interested in reading Dante in manuscripts:
               the Dante online portal of the Società Dantesca Italiana. The only manuscript fully
               transcribed in both projects is the Trivulziano (Milan, Biblioteca dell'Archivio
               storico civico e Trivulziana, Ms. Trivulziano 1080).<note xml:id="ftn1">The double
                  check may be useful, at least for spelling details: e.g., Inf, II, 2: DO toglieua
                  vs SHAW togleua; and Shaw is more consistent in the preservation of the u/v
                  instability. Nevertheless, considering the time needed to transcribe the whole
                  poem, it is worth discussing whether it is worth having two projects independently
                  carry out this task.</note>

            <p xml:id="p17">Barbara Bordalejo has authored the introductory chapter on the encoding
               system. The edition provides numerous examples of the encoding of scribal deletion,
               problematic readings, glosses and alternative readings, substitution of one reading
               for another, aspects of layout, etc. The texts have been encoded in Collate-style
               markup (specific to the collation tool <emph>Collate</emph>, see below), and later
               transformed into a customized version of XML-TEI. Starting from the transcription
               guidelines elaborated by the Società Dantesca Italiana for the <emph>Dante
                  Online</emph> website, the project created a model with which to separate 'the
               text of the document' and 'the variant states of the text'. Bordalejo observes that <cit>
                  <quote>the main goal of this new transcription system is to present a clear
                     distinction between the text of the document (i.e. what goes in the

                     editor (or the transcriber) interprets the different stages of development of
                     the text (i.e. our understanding of the text as originally written and then

               witnesses ('taxa', in evolutionary biology) at precise sites of variation
               ('characters'), to generate a phylogram: an unrooted tree. The length of the branches
               corresponds to the degree of divergence between witnesses. PAUP, which has proven to
               be particularly suited to the purposes of textual critics, uses sophisticated methods
               to find the most 'parsimonious' evolutionary tree: considering all possible
               bifurcating trees, it identifies the one that requires the smallest number of changes
               (Windram et al. 2008; Roos, Teemu, and Heikkila 2009; Young 2014). It is worth
               remembering that evolutionary trees are unrooted, i.e. they have no orientation. For
               the purposes of textual criticism, this means that the computer fails to provide

            <p xml:id="p27">In his review, Giorgio Inglese adds nuance to this conclusion,
               suggesting that 'the appearance of a peculiar relation [between the manuscripts Urb
               and Rb] is just a consequence of the selection of the witnesses' (Inglese 2012). A
               reading which seems specific to those two manuscripts can in fact appear in others
               which are not taken into account in the edition. Inglese highlights the value of the
               electronic collation that allows for an in-depth evaluation analysis by providing
               readers with the chance to check the editor's conclusions. He follows to observe
               that, as far as it regards the <emph>restitutio textus</emph>, Shaw’s hypothesis (Rb
               has a β text) leads to the same results than his own (Rb has an α text, contaminated
               with β): Rb and Urb agreement represents β.</p>

            <head>Judging variants. Editors vs machines?</head>
            <p xml:id="p28">A frequent question in Digital Humanities is whether digital
               technologies have altered methods of scholarship and, if so, how. For instance, how
               does one reckon with textual variants in the field of scholarly edition? The question
               inevitably arises wherever scholars seek to track the transmission of a work and to
               produce a critical text. In the so-called Lachmannian tradition, the editor is
               required to distinguish between variants and errors and to consider only the latter
               in drawing relations between witnesses. The trees produced in textual criticism using
               evolutionary biology methods, however, draw upon all the evidence – that is variants
               which may or may not include errors. For instance, in her analysis of the
               relationship between the ms. Urb and the ms. Rb, Shaw presents the following
               evidence: errors in common (counted as errors by Petrocchi but accepted by
               Sanguineti) and errors <emph>separativi</emph> of α (which isolates Urb and Rb),
               which amount to ten 'monogenetic variants linking Rb and Urb'. In addition, the
               editor considers small errors and variants according to the following useful taxonomy
               (for a similar list of types of polygenetic variants, see Brandoli 2007):
               substitution of a word, change in word order, addition or omission of the definite
               article, addition or omission of the first person pronoun <emph>io</emph> and/or the
               third person pronoun <emph>el</emph>, addition or omission of a small word, singular
               for plural or vice versa, variants with an extra or missing syllable which affects
               scansion, resulting in a metrical error or not, different forms of the verb,
               retouching of short phrases. As Shaw points out,<cit>
                  <quote>some of these categories are not especially significant in themselves.
                     Singly, they mean next to nothing. But it is the presence of a long series of
                     them uniformly right across the text in a very small number of manuscripts
                     which is striking (and this is surely what Petrocchi’s phrase ‘foltezza di
                     statistica’ refers to at least in part) [...] If the results of the computer
                     analysis are accepted as valid for mss. AHMT and L, there is no reason that
                     they should not be accepted as valid for mss. R and U.</quote>
                  <bibl>Shaw, Commedia, Introduction</bibl>
               </cit></p>
            <p xml:id="p29">A coherent agreement or divergence between witnesses alongside the text,
               including errors and variants, is evidence that has to be taken into account. Shaw's
               assertions are less persuasive, however, where she argues that <cit>
                  <quote>this ability of phylogenetics to create hypotheses of relationships which
                     do not require any prior judgments as to originality is one of its greatest
                     strengths for textual scholars. In classical stemmatics, as formulated by Paul
                     Maas, analysis must be based on shared error alone. Therefore, one must
                     determine at each point which reading is “original", which is “error", before
                     analysis can begin. As well as the difficulty of determining the “original"
                     reading, there is the argument elegantly expressed by Talbot Donaldson: if one
                     can determine the original reading at every point, then why bother with any
                     further analysis?</quote>
                  <bibl>Shaw, Commedia, Phylogenetic Analysis</bibl>
               </cit></p>
            <p xml:id="p30">However, determining which reading is an error in traditional stemmatics
               does not amount to identifying the original reading. For instance, an editor can
               establish that a reading that breaks the metrical scheme is an error and still have
               other witnesses with different, and potentially correct, readings; or a <emph>lectio
                  difficilior</emph> might be 'trivialized' by all scribes, in the so-called
               ‘diffraction <emph>in absentia</emph>’, such that it remains extremely difficult to
               'guess' which reading is the original and correct one. Thus what Shaw considers a
               matter of interpretation, avoidable by recourse to 'new methodology', in fact remains
               the domain of scholar's expertise.</p>
            <p xml:id="p31">Fortunately, Shaw seems to contradict her previous statement, declaring
               that 'assessing the significance of variants is a large part of the editorial
               process'. Doing it with digital technologies might be a promising field of
               investigation, which, to my knowledge, has only been pursued beyond the stage of
               theoretical assertions by few scholars (Barabucci, Di Iorio and Vitali 2014; Cadioli
               Forthcoming; a work in progress as part of the DiXiT Marie-Curie Network).</p>

               <head>VBase integrated tool</head>
               <p xml:id="p32">The edition contains an integrated tool, VBase. The tool is used to
                  retrieve variants according to their distribution across the witnesses. Though not
                  immediately intuitive, the user is able to perform complex searches and have
                  immediate results after only a short training (cf. Trovato 2014, 209). The
                  importance of this tool is underlined by Trovato, who proved his skepticism on the
                  value of the edition as a whole (Trovato 2010).</p>
               <p xml:id="p33">A query consists in asking for variants which only appear in one or
                  more selected manuscripts. Furthermore, it is possible to specify whether those
                  readings should not be present in other witnesses and to restrict the query to
                  specific parts of the text. In each query, the number of results (readings) per
                  single witness is available by checking the 'Count the hits in every witness' box.
                  Eight variant groups – sets of variants characteristic of a particular group of
                  witnesses, as a couple of manuscripts, a branch of the tradition, the editions,
                  etc. – have been defined; variant groups can be deployed in order to perform
                  searches within a single group or to have a witness react to a group. </p>
               <p xml:id="p34">The editors used VBase to visualize and analyse the collation
                  results. In the section devoted to Phylogenetic Analysis, a number of VBase
                  queries are discussed in detail; for example, according to VBase results, the
                  agreements and disagreements of Rb with the variant groups show that the
                  manuscript is a member of the β family, but shares many more readings with the α
                  branch than Urb does (note that Shaw's conclusion, in contrast with Sanguineti's,
                  is that Rb is a β witness; while Inglese considers Rb an α manuscript contaminated
                  with β).</p>

                  that allows users to process and search large SGML/XML documents. The application
                  was developed by Peter Robinson in 2000, as a successor to DynaText, and
                  extensively renovated by him and Andrew West over the following years. In 2004 it
                  was released open source. The advantages of <emph>Anastasia</emph> are that it
                  bundles the server, parsing, searching, and display handling into a single
                  package; it also assumes that any document is composed of a series of events which
                  are defined not only by their hierarchical relation, but also by their
                  left-to-right relation in the document stream. This last feature is significantly
                  different from other XML systems. New developments by the same team have flowed
                  into the <emph>SDPublisher</emph> publication system of the Scholarly Digital
                  Editions (SDE) company. The system inherited the same basic model as
                     <emph>Anastasia</emph>, with some major changes: it is not limited to Apache
                  servers, it uses Python rather than TCL for scripting and uses a database to
                  enable dynamic representations of texts. There are currently eleven editions
                  available on the SDE portal – all of them powered by
                     <emph>Anastasia/SDPublisher</emph>. Since 2010, no further developments have
                  been planned for this tool. Peter Robinson, its main promoter, has moved on to
                  different projects concerning the making and publishing of digital editions. On
                  the publication side, his dedication to Chaucer's work has resulted in the
                     <emph>CantApp</emph>, a digital edition of the Canterbury Tales for mobile
                  devices. As far as regards the creation of digital editions, his new venture is
                  the <emph>TextualCommunities</emph> portal; it aims to create free available
                  editions, in collaboration with many people and in a web-based system that does

               <head>Conclusion</head>
               <p xml:id="p42">Shaw makes several suggestions for the edition’s improvement. One of
                  them concerns the Landiano manuscript (Piacenza, Biblioteca Comunale Passerini
                  Landi, Landiano 190), which has not been included in the project, and the prospect
                  of producing for it a transcription that includes the <emph>scriptura
                     inferior</emph>, in the manner of the Ashburnam and Laurenziano manuscripts.
                  Moreover, in light of the interesting results achieved on the basis of the
                  manuscript Rb, a further controversial witness – the Madrid manuscript (Madrid,
                  Biblioteca Nacional, ms. 10186) – would be worth analysing. </p>
               <p xml:id="p43">To conclude, the <emph>Commedia</emph> digital edition is not a
                  precious resource for Dante scholars alone, but also, more broadly, for anyone
                  interested in medieval manuscripts and in textual scholarship. It provides readers
                  of Dante with an easy access to the manuscripts containing his work. The tools and
                  the methodology applied are experimental and yield high quality results. The
                  reader may or may not agree with the editor's conclusions, but the significant
                  element of the project is that the reader is at liberty to verify those
                  conclusions herself, by reading the explanation of any statement, comparing
                  transcriptions with facsimiles, comparing every reading of any line and
                  visualizing variant maps for them, testing the editor's hypothesis and formulating
                  new ones using VBase. This is the essential scholarly value of Shaw's project.</p>
               <p xml:id="p44">It is unfortunate, then, that according to the WorldCat catalogue,
                  fewer than thirty libraries in the world are in possession of the DVD or have
                  complete online access. Moreover, libraries such as the British Library, the
                  Bibliothèque nationale de France, or Cambridge University Library do not number
                  among them. The libraries which provide access to Shaw’s edition are fourteen in
                  Italy, seven in the USA, three in England, one in Spain, one in France and one in
                  Germany. Shaw's edition certainly deserves a wider distribution.</p>
