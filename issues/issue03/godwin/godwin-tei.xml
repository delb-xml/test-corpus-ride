         <div type="abstract">
            <p>William Godwin’s diary presents a range of difficulties to both researchers and
               editors. Compiled over a forty-eight year period, Godwin manages to record a
               tremendous amount of detail in the fewest possible words. This edition – the first
               time the diary text has been published – takes advantage of the digital medium to
               give researchers new ways to synthesise Godwin’s terse and codified records into
               coherent forms. The edition also includes vast amounts of secondary material,
               particularly a wealth of biographic information. At the same time, the lack of
               documentation and explicitly stated editorial methodology makes classification
               difficult: William Godwin’s Diary is an excellent historical resource that
               successfully exploits the digital medium, but falls short of meeting the criteria of
               a Scholarly Digital Edition as a work of textual scholarship.</p>

               </figure> William Godwin (1756–1836) was a leading British intellectual, political
               philosopher, novelist and journalist. As the husband of Mary Wollstonecraft, the
               father of Mary Shelley and father-in-law of Percy Bysshe Shelley, he occupied a
               prominent place in London’s philosophical and literary circles at the end of the 18th
               century. From 1788 until his death, Godwin meticulously recorded details of his life,
               including his reading and writing, and myriad social interactions.</p>
            <p xml:id="p2">The diaries, consisting of thirty-two notebooks, form one of three key
               pieces of the Abinger Collection<note xml:id="ftn1">Also contained within the Abinger
                  Collection is the five-volume ‘joint journal’ of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary
                  Shelley, and various autograph drafts of Mary Shelley’s <emph>Frankenstein</emph>.
                  The digitisation of the latter is the first stage of the <ref
                     target="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/">Shelley-Godwin Archive project</ref>,
                  which is <ref
                     target="http://ride.i-d-e.de/issues/issue-2/sga_frankenstein-notebooks/"
                     >reviewed here</ref>.</note>, which has been housed in the Bodleian Library in
               Oxford since 1974, and was purchased outright in 2004. The detail with which Godwin
               records his daily activities has made the diaries an invaluable resource for literary
               scholars and historians. His chronicling of his reading and writing has allowed
               scholars to trace the production of, and influences behind, some of Godwin’s most
               important work, including his major philosophical treatise, <emph>Enquiry Concerning
                  Political Justice</emph>. At the same time, Godwin’s meetings and presence at
               social events with leading figures of the day gives historians a wealth of
               information from which to reconstruct the vibrant political, literary and theatrical
               circles of late-18th and early-19th century London.</p>
            <p xml:id="p3">The <emph>William Godwin’s Diary</emph> project began in 2007. The
               majority of the editorial work was undertaken at the University of Oxford within the
               Department of Politics and International Relations, and under the directorship of
               David O’Shaughnessy and Mark Philp. This edition marks the first time that the diary
               text has been published in full in any format: it provides an edited and
               fully-searchable transcription of all thirty-two volumes, in addition to page
               facsimiles. The project also positions the diary as a framework for an exhaustive
               degree of historical and prosopographical research, identifying and mapping thousands
               of the people and events to which Godwin refers. While undoubtedly a substantial
               achievement, <emph>William Godwin’s Diary</emph> nevertheless exhibits signs of an
               unresolved tension between the project as a work of textual scholarship and the
               presentation of the diary as the locus of a wealth of secondary historical data.</p>

            <head>Godwin’s Diary and Digital Possibilities</head>
            <p xml:id="p4">Godwin’s diary is a challenging set of manuscripts to read. This is not
               due to any particular textual difficulties, but simply because of its sparseness:
               though filling thirty-two notebooks, the diaries, compiled over forty-eight years,
               provide minimal information for any given day. The terse, codified, manner in which
               Godwin records his daily activity makes interpretation of events in and of themselves
               very difficult. Entries are typically in the form: ‘Call on X’; ‘Y dines’; ‘theatre,
               [name of play]’; ‘write 3 pages’ – that is, as a series of activities and named
               entities. Godwin also uses a range of abbreviations (‘nah’ for ‘not at home’) and
               brief or contracted French terms (‘cala’ for ‘browsing through a text “ça et
               la”’).</p>
            <p xml:id="p5">Unlike other diarists, for instance Samuel Pepys, Godwin’s diary serves
               less as the writer’s mode of reflection upon events; rather, they are very much
               chronicles, in the most precise sense: the recording of events in chronological
               order, without any attempts at interpretation.</p>
            <p xml:id="p6">This is not to suggest that there is nothing open to interpretation at a
               close textual level: even within this formalistic mode of expression, Godwin’s use of
               abbreviations for close acquaintances, and the suggestions of intimacy through
               increasing use of ‘elle’, ‘diner chez elle/chez moi’ when referring to Mary
               Wollstonecraft, are informative. Moreover, the style of diary in general is
               indicative of Godwin’s meticulous habits (by the same token, a failure to record a
               significant event would be equally revelatory). There are also signs, at a textual
               level, of the composition of the diary: though completed daily, there is some
               evidence that Godwin copied entries from elsewhere (Cummings 2008, 3), or
               retrospectively inserted a record of an external event he considered significant (the
               Battle of Waterloo is noted, using different ink, on 18th June 1815, the day of the
               battle. Godwin, in London, cannot possibly have heard about it so quickly).</p>
            <p xml:id="p7">Beyond this, though, the diary is more apt to forms of what might be
               termed ‘synthetic reading’, for which the digital medium and digital processes are
               ideally suited. A digital edition has the potential to expose to the researcher the
               various levels ‘beyond’ the text itself: the diary as a macroscopic view of Godwin’s
               life, as a chronicle of the genesis of his literary work, and as the recorded traces
               of a complex social network.</p>
            <p xml:id="p8">As an example of the first, the significance – as an isolated incident –
               of Godwin having seen ‘Adams’, a physician, is difficult to determine (at least,
               without Godwin giving any further details); that Godwin saw Adams as often as
               fourteen times a year between 1810 and 1815, but seldom afterwards, gives a far
               broader ground for investigation. Though scholars are able to identify such trends,
               this work is essentially computational and can be greatly facilitated in a digital
               edition. Moreover, more long-term ‘latent’ trends may be exposed: as a hypothetical
               example, the number of times Godwin dined out, presented as a rolling average, could
               be highly indicative.</p>
            <p xml:id="p9">A digital, linked-data approach may aid the understanding of Godwin’s
               philosophical and literary work, mapping their creation both in time and in relation
               to his reading. The same links can be drawn with Godwin’s letters (volume one of a
               scholarly edition by Pamela Clemit was published in print in 2011). Mapping his
               literary creation in time is essentially a chronological synthesis, as described
               above. Linking the record of a work’s creation to a section of the work itself is
               more ambitious – not least as it would require digital editions of those works.</p>
            <p xml:id="p10">Finally, the diary invites a prosopographical approach to study. The
               diary can be seen as the central locus in a network of named entities and activities;
               or, rather, a representation of Godwin’s perspective upon this complex network. A
               precondition for using a digital approach to represent this network is the
               identification, and normalisation, of these named entities. The edition must also
               provide a suitable interface for exploring this network.</p>
         </div>
         <div xml:id="div3">
            <head>Aims, Parameters and Transparency of the Edition</head>
            <p xml:id="p11">As noted in the introduction, the principle aim of <emph>William
                  Godwin’s Diary</emph> appears to be the creation of a historical and
               prosopographical resource. It seems natural, therefore, that the main effort of the
               project was focused on creating a historical apparatus to ‘clarify Godwin’s entries
               and providing additional information’ (Myers, O’Shaughnessy, and Philp 2010) –
               specifically, in the identification of ‘named entities’ (people, places, events)
               within the diary text and provision of secondary sources. As a historical resource,
               the project is well documented: there is a clearly stated rationale behind the
               interpretation and encoding of Godwin’s abbreviations, and his recording of events,
               writing, people and places.</p>
            <p xml:id="p12">As an edition of the document (or document-text), however, the absence
               of explicitly stated editorial methodology is problematic. Though otherwise
               comprehensive, the ‘Editorial team and acknowledgements’-page is notably taciturn
               with respect to the text of the edition, noting only that Beth Lau ‘played a critical
               role in initiating and directing the transcription of the diary before this project
               began’. How the transcriptions were made, by whom, and, most importantly, according
               to what procedures is not documented. What implicit decisions were taken in this
               textual transfer from manuscript page to digital form? This is not to cast doubt on
               the accuracy of the transcribed text <emph>per se</emph>, but rather to recognise, as
               Pierazzo does, that transcription can never be an objective activity (Pierazzo 2011,
               474). Without an understanding of the rationale behind the subjective decisions made
               in transcribing, a reader cannot automatically assume a correspondence between a
               given feature of the document text and the text of the edition. Of course, a user is
               able to refer to the facsimile, but the requirement to do this (in effect, to
               reverse-engineer the editorial methodology) is clearly an impediment to the
               usefulness of the edition.</p>
            <p xml:id="p13">In this respect, <emph>William Godwin’s Diary</emph> falls short of
               satisfying the RIDE criterion that a Scholarly Digital Edition ‘justifies […] the
               editorial method adopted and [clearly describes] of the rules that guided the
               edition’ (Sahle and Vogeler 2014).</p>

               <head>Selection of documents</head>
               <p xml:id="p14">The selection of documents is mostly self-evident, consisting, as the
                  introduction states, of thirty two octavo notebooks covering the years
                  1788–1836.</p>
               <p xml:id="p15">There remain problems, however. One is the inclusion of the facsimile
                  of MS. Abinger e. 33, according to the Abinger catalogue a supplement to MS.
                  Abinger e. 6, one of the diary notebooks. This manuscript consists of three
                  folios, with 1r containing the title ‘Supplement to Journal / 1793 / Mar. 23’
                  written in Godwin’s hand. It is unclear whether this should be considered a part
                  of the diary: it is not one of the 32 octavo notebooks; and, as the pages have not
                  been transcribed, presumably it was not considered as such by the editors. The
                  edition does, however, include the so-called ‘1796 list’, included at the end of
                  MS. Abinger e. 7. Godwin ‘compiled the list – probably in 1805 – to map the growth
                  and range of his acquaintance over the years 1773-1805’ (Myers, O’Shaughnessy, and
                  Philp 2010). This list <emph>is</emph> included in the transcription. </p>
               <p xml:id="p16">It is not clear why the ‘1796 list’ should be considered part of the
                  diary to the extent that it is transcribed, while the ‘Supplement’ is not: neither
                  are diary entries <emph>per se</emph>. If the rationale is simply that the former
                  is contained within one of the thirty-two notebooks, it calls into question the
                  initial selection criteria (after all, the Abinger Catologue appears to consider
                  the Supplement a part of the diary). While there may be a legitimate rationale
                  behind this – on grounds of relevance, say – it is a subjective decision, and
                  without any statement to this effect there is a risk of it appearing
                  arbitrary.</p>

                  appear to fall between the materialistic and idealistic conceptions of the
                  document text. At a close textual level the transcription follows an approach that
                  is consistent with a diplomatic edition. The encoding marks various features of
                  Godwin’s writing, which are rendered typographically in the web presentation. The
                  occasional use of red ink or pencil, for instance, is indicated. Superscript,
                  punctuation marks and ampersands are encoded and rendered as in the manuscript.
                  All abbreviations and other forms whose meaning is not self-evident (such as the
                  uses of French discussed earlier) are represented as they appear in the text.
                  Neither the transcription nor the TEI-XML encoding contains expansions or other
                  interpretative textual apparatus. Instead, the site relies on both the
                  ‘Introduction’-page notes to describe common abbreviations, and cross-referencing
                  links to identify contractions of individuals’ names. Godwin’s occasional use of
                  larger or smaller handwriting – normally for wider events added after the main
                  entry was written – is also respected.</p>

                  </figure> At a structural level, there is a much greater degree of interpretation
                  and normalisation. This is based on the semantic structure of the text, reflected
                  in the mark-up of distinct time-periods, rather than the graphical structures of
                  the page. For example, in many cases, Godwin’s text overflows the lines for a
                  given day, but is encoded as part of the day to which it evidently belongs (see
                     <ref type="crossref" target="#img2">fig. 2</ref> &amp; <ref type="crossref"
                     target="#img3">3</ref>). The rationale behind this is quite understandable: any
                  abstraction from the text requires consistency in the underlying data structure.
                  This contrasts to more purely ‘documentary’ editions, which respect the graphical
                  forms of the document over abstract structures (Elena Pierazzo’s edition of
                     <emph>Jane Austen’s Juvenilia</emph>, for instance, does not mark the
                  beginnings and ends of individual stories). As I shall discuss in the
                  ‘Presentation interface’ section, the representation of the diary according to
                  abstract structures is occasionally problematic.</p>

                        separate line and aligned to the right, but the edition places it in the
                        flow of text.</head>
                  </figure> The conflation of two approaches, moreover – though consistently applied
                  at their respective levels – proves problematic at the boundaries of the textual
                  and the structural. For example, each day’s entry is encoded as a single TEI
                  anonymous block element, as we would expect, and the subsequent rendering of the
                  page does not as a result respect the document’s line-breaks. It may, indeed, be
                  argued that line breaks occurring ‘naturally’ (because the space is filled) carry
                  no significance. However, subsequent additions to the diary (see the Waterloo
                  example above) are often positioned at the <emph>bottom</emph> of the day’s
                  delineated space, and are aligned to the right margin. Though encoded as larger or
                  smaller text, these additions appear to be part of the main entry. This
                  potentially misleading situation again reinforces the need for greater
                  documentation concerning the editorial methodology.</p>

               <head>Modelling of data</head>
               <p xml:id="p20">With a high level of structure (as one would expect from a diary) and
                  the codification of semantic entities, Godwin’s diary may be seen as being closer
                  to discrete data than to linear text. As a work of prosopography, the diary might
                  be encoded along the lines of Bradley’s work on the <emph>Prosopography of the
                     Byzantine Empire</emph>. This approach advocates the use of relational
                  databases to store textual data that has already been reduced to what Bradley
                  calls ‘factoids’ (indeed, a series of factoids seems an appropriate description of
                  Godwin’s diary). Moreover, according to Cummings, the project was conceived as
                  data-centric: <cit>
                     <quote>Unlike those working in History or English, the project members are
                        perhaps more interested in the statistics one can generate from the encoded
                        texts than the textual phenomena present in the diary itself.</quote>
                     <bibl>Cummings 2008, 2</bibl>
                  </cit></p>
               <p xml:id="p21">That a different approach, namely the use of TEI-XML and an eXist
                  database, was employed instead is indicative of a desire to create,
                  simultaneously, an edition of the document text. Using a relational database
                  requires too great a degree of abstraction and normalisation, from which it is
                  difficult to reconstruct linear text.</p>
               <p xml:id="p22">The TEI encoding contains a level of structural mark-up – a
                  TEI-headed document for each year of the diary, divided into days with abstract
                  divisions – and, contained within, both text-level mark-up (see above) and
                  prosopographical mark-up of named entities as inline elements. While making
                  mapping and interlinking more difficult compared to a purely relational model, the
                  link between the data and the textual transcription is retained. As previously
                  noted, it is a functional requirement that the structural mark-up be rigidly
                  enforced; also, given the required integrity of named entities, the
                  prosopographical mark-up necessarily supersedes textual features such as
                  deletions. This is a justifiable pragmatic decision, but one which reaffirms the
                  focus of the project on the wider, historical context of Godwin’s life rather than
                  on the document or the text.</p>

                  database, which enables the kinds of complex queries required for the interlinking
                  of entities, using XQuery syntax. Diary pages, which appear to be simple
                  renderings of the underlying XML, are transformed to HTML using XSLT stylesheets
                  by Apache’s Cocoon. The canonical entity page (people, events) is, I assume,
                  generated from the database using XQuery. Filtering of lists and other data
                  manipulation are carried out on the client side using JavaScript libraries such as
                  JQuery Datatables, producing a snappy interface, and obviating the need for more
                  complex AJAX-based approaches and constant querying of the database. However, this
                  limits the user to either a ‘download all the data and filter’ approach, or

                  consideration than the digitisation of material or the back-end infrastructure. In
                  general, it feels as if the site was designed primarily for the conversion of
                  data: as such, pages appear to be renderings of the structure of the XML documents
                  in HTML, rather than the extraction of this data and its incorporation into a site
                  more focused on user experience.</p>

                  </figure> The main site navigation is achieved through a series of drop-down menus
                  (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img5">fig. 5</ref>), which, more than anything,
                  serve to hide search categories from the user (sometimes in two-deep dropdowns).
                  The layout of the menus also appears ambiguous, conveying little sense of the
                  structure of the site. It also fails to clearly distinguish between general
                  information about the project, transcriptions, and scans of the editions, and
                  extrapolated data: all are presented as dropdowns in a single menu bar. A far more
                  informative layout would, I feel, represent the difference between the diary pages
                  and what are, in essence, abstract approaches to exploring the diary.</p>

               <head>Presentation interface</head>
               <p xml:id="p26">The default interface for displaying the diary transcriptions is on a
                  yearly basis: after selecting <emph>Diary</emph> &gt; <emph>Transcription</emph>
                  from the dropdown menu, the user is presented with a list of years; clicking one
                  of these links returns all the data for the selected year. Though this view
                  features a useful tool to highlight entity types within the text, having to
                  manually scroll through an entire year is tiresome. Conversely, selecting an
                  instance of an entity (say, a dinner with a particular individual) returns only
                  the entry for the day in question, requiring the user to return to the full-year
                  view for greater contextualisation. These two options appear either too widely
                  spread or too narrowly focused to be particularly useful.</p>
               <p xml:id="p27">Presenting the diary entries on yearly pages also creates disconnect
                  with the manuscript scans (Godwin filled up notebooks in order, rather than using
                  one notebook per year). Though there are links next to each entry to the document
                  scan, some kind of split-screen view would allow a direct comparison of the
                  edition text with the facsimile.</p>

                  by shelf-mark. Within the facsimile view there is a forward-by-folio and
                  forward-by-volume option, giving a sense of place within the diaries. Given the
                  scale of the diaries (and the general difficulties with close-reading such a
                  text), a browsing approach is perhaps not the most useful. It would have been
                  helpful for the ‘catalogue of facsimiles’ page to give the date range covered by a
                  particular volume, or for the list of transcribed years to feature some sort of
                  overview.</p>
               <p xml:id="p29">The site provides two search-based facilities: a Google engine-based
                  search of the entire site, and a site-based search allowing a query of one or two
                  key words (with and/or options) or whole-phrase matching. The site-based search
                  can also be applied to the additional biographical material (though this is,
                  confusingly, labelled as a search of ‘People’). The lack of facility to filter
                  results (by date ranges, for instance) necessitates reading of all the returned
                  entries. Of course, the results are not ordered by ‘relevance’ in the way that
                  Google does as there is no criterion for determining whether a given entry is more
                  relevant than any other; at the same time, this may not be evident to the
                  user.</p>
               <p xml:id="p30">Substantially more useful is the ability to explore the diary through
                  the various entities: this has the advantage for the user of being able to filter
                  lists of results rather than having to enter search terms blindly. Thanks to the
                  use of the JQuery Datatables plugin, and all the data being downloaded to the
                  client before filtering, the process is rapid and allows an iterative approach to
                  searching. Re-use of this interface for the main search facility would be a
                  welcome improvement.</p>

                  dependent on this, in addition to the interface’s capacity to represent abstract
                  views of the data. In some places, this is particularly successful: the pages for
                  identified individuals contain not only a list of their mentions in the diary, but
                  also a graph of their distribution (see <ref type="crossref" target="#img6">fig.

                  transcription can be downloaded from a link at the bottom of the page.
                  Interestingly, each year is presented as a full TEI document, including the
                  TEI-Header. When downloading the XML for a single day, however, only the wrapping
                  ‘abstract segment’ element is included. As standalone files, these should also, I
                  feel, contain header information describing its contents. Given that the
                  yearly-based full TEI-XML files are an abstraction anyway, artificially including

                  publication (as five years have elapsed since publication, it seems unlikely that
                  it will be completed). The API itself apparently allows developers to submit
                  requests to the database using XQuery. If this were fully realised in a stable way
                  for the long term it would allow external developers to query and present the data
                  in a range of different ways, possibly fulfilling some of the potential hinted at
                  by the current site. Developments in JavaScript libraries could, indeed, allow the
                  functionality of the site – graphical representations and data-mashing, for
                  instance – to be moved to the client side entirely.</p>

            <head>Concluding remarks</head>
            <p xml:id="p36">As a historical resource, <emph>William Godwin’s Diary</emph> is of
               great value to researchers: the identification of people referred to in the diary,
               the inclusion of a wealth of secondary source material, and the provision of the
               technical apparatus to enable new modes of exploring a very large amount of
               historical textual data, are immense scholarly achievements. In this respect, the
               project makes very effective use of digital paradigms and processes.</p>
            <p xml:id="p37">It is in the desire to include the text of the diary that the tension
               alluded to in the introduction arises. Indeed, through the historical apparatus and
               the macro-structures employed for their organisation and presentation, the resource
               is useful as a research tool even without the text or scans of the diary itself: the
               formalistic style of the diary means that little information is lost between Godwin’s
               writing ‘Dine with X’ and a point on a graph representing the dinner.</p>
            <p xml:id="p38">The impulse to include the text itself is natural enough, though (not
               least to make it available via the web). As such I think there is sufficient ground
               to consider <emph>William Godwin’s Diary</emph> at least a <emph>de facto</emph>
               Scholarly Digital Edition. In this respect, as I have argued, it lacks clear
               documentation concerning textual editorial methodology (as opposed to the historical
               research). Given the relative absence of textual complexity (a highly codified,
               neatly written, single-witness manuscript), the editorial decisions made are few and
               largely common sense. Still, this is not quite enough: if the various schools of
               scholarly editing have any commonality, it is in their undertaking to articulate the
               relation between the text of the edition and the text(s) of the source documents. I
               do not doubt that the transcribers and editors had a clear idea of what they were
               doing, but they have not documented it in the edition and so the user (and the
               reviewer) can only retrospectively deduce what that idea might have been. As a
               Scholarly Digital Edition, <emph>William Godwin’s Diary</emph> is certainly lacking
               in this respect.</p>
            <p xml:id="p39">Nevertheless, the project highlights on-going debates in the field of
               digital scholarship. In particular: what is a Scholarly Digital Edition when shifting
               digital paradigms alter the possible modes of representing and analysing a text?</p>
            <p xml:id="p40">This conflict, I would argue, is central to the tension I have described
               in <emph>William Godwin’s Diary</emph>. Fully describing the text with mark-up
               requires a degree of flexibility (for which, it must be said, TEI is well designed)
               to capture its inevitably idiosyncratic nature. As we attempt to capture in more
               detail the text as embodied in its physical medium, or in textual variants between
               witnesses, the number of idiosyncrasies grows. On the other hand, an analytical
               approach, such <emph>Godwin</emph> achieves through abstract representation of people
               and activities, necessitates a much more formalistic encoding, with regular
               structures and normalisation. With a text that is already highly formalised, thanks
               to Godwin’s codified style, <emph>Godwin’s Diary</emph> seems like low-hanging fruit.
               More complex documents, with more text, with revisions and material damage, cannot as
               easily be reduced to such data structures without loss of information. In the latter
               case, how far can an abstraction of a text (or reduction to data) be taken before it
               can still be considered representative – an edition – of the source material? </p>
            <p xml:id="p41">Indeed, it may be argued that <emph>William Godwin’s Diary</emph>
               inverts the traditional relationship between the document or text of the scholarly
               edition and its apparatus: the historical apparatus, exhaustive as it is, and via the
               modes of its presentation, becomes the ‘text’ of the edition; and the documentary
               basis of the edition forms a framework, a kind of supporting apparatus. If such a
               paradigm is to be validated, though, scholarly rigour all the way down – at a textual
               level, even if the text is not the predominate focus – will be necessary.</p>
