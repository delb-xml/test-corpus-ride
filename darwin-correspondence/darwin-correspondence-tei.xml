                <p>Charles Darwin‚Äôs correspondences are an invaluable resource for understanding his
                    theories and works as well as English social life of the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century. About 15,000 letters are known, of which
                    many appear for the first time in this hybrid print and digital edition of the
                    <emph>Darwin Correspondence Project</emph>. It presents an
                    authoritative edition of the letters from and to Darwin that is based on
                    up-to-date scholarly standards and that is as comprehensive as possible. The
                    completion of this project in progress is scheduled for 2022. Currently, all
                    letters until 1875 are online with full transcriptions, and all remaining
                    letters until Darwin‚Äôs death in 1882 are available in their metadata and
                    summaries. Explanatory notes and extensive contextual essays provide valuable
                    background information. The technical realisation of the project via the Epsilon
                    framework is convincing as the edition is intuitively easy to use. It is,
                    however, not possible to view the TEI-encoded files of the letters or to
                    download the transcriptions and essays. With plenty of additional material, the
                    <emph>Darwin Correspondence Project</emph> exceeds the scope of an
                    edition and presents a widely interlinked online project that makes it a
                    valuable and rich resource.</p>

                        only conducted research in the field of evolution. He also worked in the

                        lasting more than 70 years, he was in regular contact with numerous
                        scientists, scholars, and savants, engaging in intellectual debate and
                        discussing new ideas. Darwin was an observant contemporary of the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century and an important witness to the
                        developments of his time.</p>
                    <p n="2">Darwin maintained extensive correspondences with a large number of people,
                        with friends, family members, colleagues, and fellow scientists. His
                        letters‚Äîas well as the letters he received from many hundreds of
                        correspondents‚Äîprovide substantial insight into his intellectual and
                        scientific networks as well as the development of his theories. Besides
                        discussing his ideas with his peers, Darwin used letters to collect data,
                        figures, and facts to support and verify his theories.<note xml:id="ftn2" n="2">

                        He made marginal notes, colour coded subjects with pens and crossed out
                        whole paragraphs of information already included in his writings. Darwin
                        cut out pieces of information of the letters and filed them with his
                        notes or stuck them into his experiment book.<note xml:id="ftn3" n="3">

                        up-to-date scholarly editorial criteria is beyond doubt. As Darwin
                        unfortunately burned piles of old letters when he needed space to store new

                            to Darwin‚Äôs correspondence with a chronological list of all letters
                            written by and to Darwin published in 1985 (Burkhardt 1985).<note xml:id="ftn14" n="14"> A

                            was published containing letters from 1821 to 1836 (Burkhardt, and Smith

                            intended 30 volumes is scheduled for 2022. Selections of letters of this

                            are based on either original letters (and their digital facsimiles
                            respectively) or the best available source against which they are

                            The original spelling by Darwin and his correspondence partners are
                            retained, including mistakes. The paragraphs but not the line breaks
                            seem to be reproduced. Unfortunately, more detailed information on
                            single text phenomena and their editorial handling are missing from the
                            section ‚ÄòEditorial policy and practice‚Äô. Hopefully, the editing

                        <p n="9">Darwin often marked passages and made marginal notes and additions that
                            were usually rather short but could also grow into texts of several
                            (attached) pages (Burkhardt, and Smith 1985, xxix). These notes are
                            handled in two different ways. First, notes on letters he received are

                            and displayed under the transcription of the text. Here, line numbers
                            are given but these refer to the printed edition and therefore might not
                            be valid for the online presentation.<note xml:id="ftn19" n="19">

                                </note> Second, Darwin‚Äôs deletions, additions, and other changes
                            to his own letters appear in the print edition in the appendix and not
                            in the transcribed text. As the print edition‚Äôs chapter on editorial
                            policy states, the ‚Äòclear-text‚Äô method was followed to keep the text
                            free of brackets recording deletions, insertions, and other changes
                            (Burkhardt, and Smith 1985, xxvi). At present, these changes can only be
                            found in the print edition‚Äôs appendix, and are not included in the
                            digital edition.<note xml:id="ftn20" n="20"> E.g. the print edition records six
                                    alterations by Darwin in a letter to his father Robert Darwin
                                    from 23 October 1825 (Burkhardt, and Smith 1985, 573), but the

                            They will probably be incorporated at some point in the future, although
                            it is not stated clearly in the section ‚ÄòEditorial policy and

                    <p n="10">The page offers several ways of navigating and of getting to individual
                        letters. The menu shown on each page offers tabs to ‚ÄòThe letters‚Äô,
                        ‚ÄòCommentary‚Äô, ‚ÄòPeople‚Äô, and others. This structures the content of the page
                        very well and efficiently leads the user to the information he or she is
                        looking for, to the essays, or letters. Below the menu, the homepage shows
                        the category ‚ÄòMeet the correspondents‚Äô with pictures of (regularly changing)
                        eight correspondents as another possible access point. The links lead to
                        their biographies and then to selected ‚Äòrelated letters‚Äô. 
 There is a news
                        section‚Äîalthough it is not labelled that way nor does it give the
                        publication date or lead to a ‚Äònews archive‚Äô‚Äîthat informs of (major)
                        additions, publications, and new online features. Keywords on the right of
                        the screen may attract the user‚Äôs attention and lead to a compilation of
                        links to essays or letters within the project‚Äôs website.</p>

                            self-explanatory. The main part of the screen is occupied with the
                            transcription. Below, one can find annotations by Darwin in the letters
                            he received in the ‚ÄòCD annotations‚Äô section, and the commentary in the
                            ‚ÄòFootnotes‚Äô section. 

                            Occasionally, more detailed information on special circumstances or
                            mentioned people and works is desirable. For example, a letter by Darwin
                            to his fianc√©e Emma Wedgwood from November 1838 deals with their recent
                            engagement and future plans which is not obvious to the reader at first

                                </note> There is no commentary at all for this letter, and only
                            the summary in the metadata section states that this is the first letter
                            after their engagement which finally makes the context and the content
                            of the letter more comprehensible to the reader. Sometimes one
                            wishes for more information when people and their works are mentioned.
                            Full names are given in the commentary but no other information like
                            dates of birth and death, or the relation to the sender or addressee.

                                    Sometimes, a query with the abbreviated bibliographic

                                    a bibliographic reference to ‚ÄòWells 1815‚Äô is given in
                                    footnote¬†4. In the bibliography, however, no entry can be found

                                    But this information will probably be supplemented at a later

                            search results for bibliographic items are just shown in a list in which
                            the items are not clickable. Therefore, the books or articles do not
                            have individual pages (yet?) where one might, for example, trace the
                            steps to other letters with other correspondents in which a respective
                            text was also mentioned.</p>

                                    following letters and just shows letters from the end of 1822 at
                                    the top of the list.</note> The window displaying the list
                            cannot be enlarged probably due to webpage display reasons. So one has
                            to scroll up and down as well as to the right to read the summary that
                            is sometimes cut off. Therefore, there is a little pop-up window that
                            shows this information again for easy reading plus a link to the letter.
                            The same is true for the tab ‚ÄòWith this correspondent‚Äô that gives a good
                            overview just of the letters between Darwin and the correspondence

                            It would be desirable to get a list of all letters in the edition
                            in which this person is just being mentioned as this further improves
                            the interlinking of people within the project. This could be easily
                            integrated into the index page as the names in the letters are encoded
                            and therefore retrievable. As it is now, the user can only generate such
                            a list by using the search box. The search results, however, only
                            approximately comply with such a list as all letters from and to the
                            respective person and all letters from people with similar names are
                            included as well.</p>

                            matter what content is being displayed, e.g. an essay, an edited letter,
                            or an entry from the register of names. It is thus very convenient to
                            perform a simple search or run a query via the advanced search form from
                            each web page of the edition. The general search covers all aspects of
                            the edition (transcriptions, scholarly commentary, metadata, summaries,
                            index entries, additional texts, essays, editorial policy, etc.).
                            Refining the results is possible for document types (letter,
                            bibliography, people, repository), senders and/or addressees (these
                            categories are oddly called ‚ÄòAuthor‚Äô, ‚ÄòAddressee‚Äô, and ‚ÄòCorrespondent‚Äô),
                            and the date of sending. 

                            The advanced search form allows for a query with more detailed search
                                parameters<note xml:id="ftn44" n="44"> E.g. just in transcriptions, commentary,

                            register of names or the bibliography. One problem with the search
                            function is the query for names with initials like ‚ÄòJ. S. Henslow‚Äô as
                            they are commonly given in the footnotes. Such a query works fine in the
                            advanced search but delivers no results in the general search with the
